A volatile political climate, where news is weaponized for political gain — a state further exacerbated by black-box algorithms protected as corporate secrets that dictate the information we see. Their unknowable nature breeds conspiratorial ideas about the flow and control of information. Trust in what we see online decreases, and news fatigue grows more widespread, especially among the least engaged political-news consumers. Those who are checked out become even more susceptible to cynicism and deception.\n A global pandemic and its attendant fear and uncertainty will only add more strain into an already flawed and complex system. Politically, we can already see the contours of the information war around the coronavirus. For Democrats, the response to the virus is a demonstration of the failure of America’s health care and private insurance systems — and a way to highlight the incompetence of the Trump administration. At the same time, the Trump administration and the pro-Trump media ecosystem are invoking factual reporting about the seriousness of the virus and concern about government ineptitude to claim political bias and downplay the risks to Americans. A legitimate public health crisis becomes yet another choose-your-own-reality event, a wedge to amplify divisions.\n Information pollution bleeds into our online commerce systems as well. Conspiracy grifters like the website Infowars are already stoking fears of government-caused food shortages, using fear to drive product sales.

Clothing and food packaging that have been exposed to someone with the virus seem to present a low risk. Healthy people who are together in the grocery store or workplace experience a tolerable risk — so long as they take precautions like wearing surgical masks and spacing themselves out.\n A complete lockdown of society is the most effective way to stop spread of the virus, but it is costly both economically and psychologically. When society eventually reopens, risk-reduction measures like maintaining personal space and practicing proper hand-washing will be essential to reducing high-dose infections. High-risk sites for high-dose exposure, like stadiums and convention venues, should remain shuttered. Risky but essential services like public transportation should be allowed to operate — but people must follow safety measures such as wearing masks, maintaining physical spacing and never commuting with a fever.\n Now is the time to stay home.

Living with an invisible outside threat, and no visible outlet, forced my daughter and me to negotiate and reconcile — and fast.\n Reminders to wash hands were initially met with scorn.

The next episodes will be live on July 24 and 31 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time.\n Preparation: Whether you’re a featured couple on the show or watching it live, you’ll want to “have a clean face, a mirror and forward-facing lighting from a desk lamp,” Ms. Coleman said. “Don’t go for overhead or backlighting as these create shadows. You want to be able to see your skin up close in the best light possible.” Also, have some of your favorite products in front of you so you can follow along.\n Advice: Ms. Coleman suggested taking a self-care moment together the night before with a hydrating or detoxing mask so your skin is clean and fresh the following day.\n Katelyn McCullough, who describes herself as a wedding-beauty matchmaker, owns Elwynn + Cass, a beauty concierge service that focuses on connecting brides, grooms and wedding party members with the right hair and makeup artist, at no extra fee.\n “Most clients email me what they’re looking for or we do a 15- to 20-minute consultation on the phone,” said Ms. McCullough, whose company is based in San Diego. Last year she matched 500 clients with beauty pros. “Once I understand what you want, I recommend three or four options, which includes prices, years of experience, the artist’s bio and examples of their work.”","1622085613","6","2");

Hence the penchant for bullying, the vicious misogyny, and the explosive violence. Hence, too, the vulnerability to taunts. Especially those bearing a latent or explicit sexual charge.”\n Trump’s fear of emasculation led to his de-mask-ulation. Instead of cleaving to science and reason, he stuck with the old, corny Gordon Gekko routine, putting concern for the stock market above all else.\n Like Macbeth, the president made tragic errors of judgment and plunged his country into a nightmare.

Republicans, though, are so convinced that the few extra hundred dollars in jobless pay is keeping people from work that they are loath to renew it.

Pfizer will ship special coolers, each containing at least 1,000 doses, directly to locations determined by each state’s governor. At first, almost all of those sites will probably be hospitals that have confirmed they can store shipments at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit, as the Pfizer vaccine requires, or use them quickly.\n Federal officials have repeatedly suggested that people who are not in the priority groups — healthy adults under 65 who don’t work in health care or otherwise qualify as essential workers — should have access to the vaccine by May or June, because there will be enough supply by then. But a lot will have to go right for that to happen. One factor is whether, or when, other vaccines besides Pfizer’s and Moderna’s are approved. Once the vaccine becomes widely available, most people will be able to get it in doctor’s offices and at pharmacies. \n Employers do have the right to compel their workers to be vaccinated. Many hospital systems, for example, require annual flu shots. But employees can seek exemptions based on medical reasons or religious beliefs. In such cases, employers are supposed to provide a “reasonable accommodation”; with a coronavirus vaccine, a worker might be allowed to wear a mask in the office instead, or to work from home.\n This depends on a number of factors, including the supply in your area at the time you’re vaccinated and whether certain vaccines are found to be more effective in certain populations, such as older adults. At first, the only choice is likely to be Pfizer’s vaccine, assuming it is approved. Moderna asked the F.D.A. for emergency authorization on Monday; if approved, it would most likely become available within weeks after Pfizer’s.\n Some participants in both Pfizer’s and Moderna’s trials have said they experienced symptoms including fever, muscle aches, bad headaches and fatigue after receiving the shots, but the side effects generally did not last more than a day. Still, preliminary data suggests that, compared with most flu vaccines, the coronavirus shots have a somewhat higher rate of such reactions, which are almost always normal signs that the body’s immune response is kicking in. At the meeting of the C.D.C. advisory committee last week, some members said it would be important for doctors to warn their patients about possible side effects and assure them of the vaccines’ safety.","1784630788","6","2");

Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday.\n When the first vaccinations were given in New York earlier this month, doctors and nurses said they believed the end of the epidemic was in sight. But the pace of administering vaccinations has gone more slowly than anticipated in New York City.\n Dr. Ronald Scott Braithwaite, a professor at N.Y.U. Grossman School of Medicine who has been modeling New York City’s epidemic and is an adviser to the city, said that his team’s analysis suggested that once 10 to 20 percent of the city was vaccinated, the number of new cases would begin to drop — so long as social distancing and mask wearing remained constant and the new variant did not find a foothold in New York.\n “If the new variant replaces the existing variant and we don’t vaccinate quickly, the second wave will start cresting again and will crest really high, and that’s something to take really seriously,” Dr. Braithwaite said.\n But achieving the goal of vaccinating 10 to 20 percent of the city is still a far way off. In the first 17 days of the vaccination rollout, about 88,140 people had received the first of two doses, the equivalent of about 1 percent of the city’s population.
