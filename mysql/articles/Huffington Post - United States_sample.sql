And by “advice,” I mean any reassurance I’m not screwing it up. I click on everything from pandemic-related regression headlines to superhero face mask shopping guides, hoping to feel just a bit better about the well-intentioned yet inadequate ways I’m navigating this bizarre year for my 5- and 3-year-old boys. \n But for all my clicking, there’s still an issue I haven’t seen addressed: the one having to do with magic. And now that the kitchen calendar is down to its last page and holiday ads are everywhere, I’m trying to figure out how to handle it.\n My family celebrates Christmas, and when I was a kid, that turning of the calendar to Dec. 1 generated a magical force that glowed straight through till New Year’s. This force was so powerful that it caused garlands to sprout from our staircase, warded off homework and transformed my parents from unfulfilled housekeeper and exhausted commuter into storybook mother and father with all-new capabilities like baking pies and felling trees — while singing. My sister and I were also transformed: no longer bickering kids with “pigpen” rooms who went to bed in faded Ziggy T-shirts, but well-mannered children in ruffled nightgowns who drifted to sleep by the glow of plug-in window candles. We were in a magnificent spell.","1784761059","2","2");

He added, “While we still have issues to work through, everybody, I think, feels much better that we’re taking a clear position.”\n Mandating vaccines does have the potential for blowback, however. The outcry over mask mandates shows there’s a possibility that a vaccine mandate could produce a similar backlash. Further, many CEOs might be reluctant to institute a mandate that could cause workers to quit and further exacerbate severe staffing shortages of health care workers.\n The root causes of people’s reluctance to get vaccinated are complex and highly individual. “Vaccine hesitancy always comes in many flavors, and this vaccine is no different,” Buttenheim said. She pointed to specific concerns around the COVID-19 vaccines, including the perceived speed with which they were developed and the politicization of the approval process. “But a deeper, harder source of hesitancy,” she added, “is the justified distrust among Black and Brown and Native communities given a long history of medical mistreatment and exploitation.”\n People of color, who have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic, make up a disproportionate share of health care workers. Vaccine hesitancy remains relatively strong in communities of color. According to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll, 35% of Black adults say they would definitely not or probably not get vaccinated.","1839523014","2","2");
