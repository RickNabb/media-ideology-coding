Evers on Monday issued an executive order that bars in-person voting Tuesday and moves the state's spring election to June 9. It also calls lawmakers back into session this week to decide whether the election should be held at a different date. But the move is expected to immediately be challenged by Republican lawmakers who want to keep polls open and adjourned the Legislature on Monday without taking up measures to delay the election that Evers called for on Friday. … Evers’ order is likely the last move he can make to try to stop in-person voting Tuesday. In issuing the order, Evers is arguing he has the power to suspend voting even without legislative action, a position he has not previously held.”How did they screw things up? - FiveThirtyEight: “Well, it was harder for Wisconsin than other states because it is also holding general elections for several local offices — judges, mayors, county executives — including some whose terms begin on April 20 (so the election had to take place before then). In addition, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers probably did not have the power to alter the election without the consent of the Republican legislature, and that was always unlikely given the bad blood between the two. In fact, not only did Evers and the legislature not change the date of the election, but they have also been unable to agree on any statutory changes to the state’s election procedures in the face of restrictions on gatherings because of the coronavirus.”Coronavirus response sharply partisan in Wisconsin - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: “Assembly Republicans are calling on Gov. Tony Evers to allow in-person services for Easter and Passover amid the deadly coronavirus pandemic. ‘It is more important than ever that we allow Wisconsinites to observe their individual faiths,’ Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and the other members of the Assembly GOP caucus wrote in a Friday letter to Evers. … Evers declined the request. … The Republicans' request came one day before Republicans in the Assembly and Senate stalled Evers' move to push back Tuesday's election due to the coronavirus pandemic ravaging countries around the world. On Saturday, they quickly adjourned a special legislative session about the matter. During Saturday's proceedings, the state Assembly and state Senate each gaveled in and out within seconds and recessed until Monday.”What to expect - FiveThirtyEight: “As of Sunday, 1,268,587 absentee ballots had been requested for the election — far more than election officials are equipped to handle. Not only is that almost six times as many as were cast in Wisconsin’s 2016 presidential primary, but it’s also probably a higher volume of absentee ballots than Wisconsin has ever handled. In the 2016 general election, for instance, only 819,316 absentee ballots were counted. In addition to the avalanche of ballots arriving by mail, polling places may also be overwhelmed on Tuesday due to a dire shortage of poll workers. As of last Tuesday, almost 60 percent of municipalities in Wisconsin did not have enough poll workers, and more than 100 did not have any. The situation was critical enough that Evers has asked members of the Wisconsin Army National Guard to staff some precincts, but it is still not expected to be enough.”Biden says Milwaukee convention may be 'virtual' - ABC News: “Former Vice President Joe Biden said Sunday on ABC's ‘This Week’ that the recently delayed Democratic Convention will have to happen, but conceded that it may need to be held virtually if the novel coronavirus continues to pose a public health threat by mid-August. ‘Well, we're going to have to do a convention. We may have to do a virtual convention. I think we should be thinking about that right now. The idea of holding the convention is going to be necessary. We may not be able to put 10, 20, 30,000 people in one place and that's very possible. Again let's see where it is -- and what we do between now and then is going to dictate a lot of that as well. But my point is that I think you just got to follow the science,’ Biden told ABC News' Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos.”THE RULEBOOK: TOUGH ENOUGH NOT TO FIGHT “The rights of neutrality will only be respected when they are defended by an adequate power. A nation, despicable by its weakness, forfeits even the privilege of being neutral.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 11TIME OUT: MORE MUSIC FOR MUSIC CITY Garden & Gun: “The National Museum of African American Music will open this year in Nashville amid the glow of neon-lit honky-tonks. But given the African roots of country music, such as the introduction of the banjo, the placement makes sense. Music City, after all, gets its moniker not from country alone, but from the history of diverse music made in town, from the Fisk Jubilee Singers to R&B along Jefferson Street to, of course, rock and roll. ‘There’s music everywhere in Nashville,’ says Darius Rucker, who has signed on to be one of the museum’s national chairs. … Rucker himself knows about playing across genres, making the leap from being the lead singer and guitarist for the multiplatinum Hootie & the Blowfish to a chart-topping country artist and the first African American with a number-one country song since Charley Pride. … As the National Museum of African American Music builds programming for younger generations, Rucker’s causes for children and music history will likely converge—yet another reason to sing.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARDESTIMATED DELEGATES FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATIONBiden: 1,217Sanders: 914[Ed. note: 1,991 delegates needed to win]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE Average approval: 48.4 percentAverage disapproval: 47.8 percentNet Score: 0.6 percentChange from one week ago: ↑ 1.4 points[Average includes: Grinnell/Selzer: 48% approve - 48% disapprove; ABC News/WaPo: 49% approve - 47% disapprove; Fox News: 48% approve - 51% disapprove; Gallup: 49% approve - 45% disapprove; Monmouth University: 48% approve - 48% disapprove.]WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT? You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

Talk to you soon!  TRUMP MAY TAP ECON TEAM TO MIRROR VIRUS SQUAD Bloomberg: “President Donald Trump said he’s ‘thinking about’ forming a panel to examine how best to restart the country’s economy, which he earlier termed a ‘good idea.’ ‘I’m thinking about it,’ Trump said Saturday at a White House Press conference. ‘I continue to say, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself.’ … Trump early tweeted an endorsement of a plan offered by Dana Perino, former press secretary to President George W. Bush. Perino, now [the anchor of “The Daily Briefing” on Fox News, suggested assembling ‘a nonpartisan/bipartisan mix of experts across industry sectors’ who could advise the president about overcoming the economic difficulties stemming from harsh social districting measures suggested by the federal government. Perino said this group would complement the team led by Vice President Mike Pence, which includes health, national security and emergency preparedness officials. ‘Let 1st task force focus on crisis at the moment,’ Perino tweeted.”Dems divided on how to target Trump over economic implosion - Politico: “For most of the presidential campaign... many Democrats acknowledged they had no cohesive economic message of their own. But now that the coronavirus has laid waste to the surging stock market and low unemployment, Democrats are discovering another obstacle — framing a coherent economic argument that all the party’s factions can rally around. It’s already become a source of friction within the Democratic Party, even as some major Democratic outside groups begin pummeling Trump for the economic fallout of the pandemic. It’s a message Democrats plan to amplify in coming months, long after the immediate health effects of the crisis subside. The left flank is increasing pressure on Joe Biden, the party’s likely nominee, to adopt more progressive economic policies. Activists accuse Trump of prioritizing corporate America over low-wage workers, while many moderate Democrats are leery of drawing such distinctions, training their criticism of Trump solely on his initial mishandling of the pandemic.”Vernon Smith: Economy will bounce back, but beware inflation - WSJ: “A more common postcrisis question may be whether policy makers overreacted when fear and uncertainty were at their height. We will never know the answer, but the current anxiety of economic doom will surely pass along with the pandemic. In fact, with more money chasing goods in stretched production schedules, inflation is a real possibility. Inflation disrupts and distorts the ability of the pricing system to coordinate and direct economic productivity. When everyone rushes to spend for fear that prices will rise, we observe the destructive opposite of what happens when everyone is stuck at home. Witness the nightmare inflation rates in Zimbabwe and Venezuela.”Crisis offers Rubio an opportunity - Politico: “As chairman of the usually sleepy Small Business Committee, [Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.] has a key position in the country’s response and recovery from the pandemic. His panel’s $377 billion lifeline for small businesses is a linchpin of Congress’ $2 trillion economic rescue package, and Rubio’s efforts are winning praise from Republicans and Democrats alike even as implementation of the program remains deeply uncertain. … In the span of a decade, he’s gone from tea party rising star to immigration deal-cutter and top-tier presidential contender to foot soldier in Trump’s Republican Party. Now, Rubio’s emergence as a leading responder to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus is fueling talk among his colleagues that he, like a handful of prominent Senate Republicans, is keeping an eye on where his party goes in 2024, when Trump is no longer the GOP’s standard-bearer.”FIRED I.G. SAYS IT WAS TRUMP’S RETRIBUTIONFox News: “Michael Atkinson broke his silence Sunday saying he's ‘disappointed and saddened’ at President Trump's late-night decision [Friday] to fire him from his watchdog post in the intelligence community. ‘It is hard not to think that the president's loss of confidence in me derives from my having faithfully discharged my legal obligations as an independent and impartial inspector general, and from my commitment to continue to do so,’ Atkinson wrote in a two-page statement. The watchdog had alerted Congress to concerns about a Trump phone call with the president of Ukraine – a matter that led to the president’s impeachment last year. Atkinson stood by his decision to disclose a whistleblower's complaint against Trump, adding: ‘Those of us who vowed to protect a whistleblower's right to safely be heard must, to the end, do what we promised to do, no matter how difficult and no matter the personal consequences.’”Trump not sorry - NYT: “Mr. Trump made no effort at a news briefing on Saturday to pretend that the dismissal was anything other than retribution for Mr. Atkinson’s action under a law requiring such complaints be disclosed to lawmakers. ‘I thought he did a terrible job, absolutely terrible,’ Mr. Trump said. ‘He took a fake report and he brought it to Congress.’ Capping a long, angry denunciation of the impeachment, he added, ‘The man is a disgrace to I.G.s. He’s a total disgrace.’ Mr. Trump’s hunt for informers and turncoats proceeds even while most Americans are focused on the coronavirus outbreak that has killed thousands and shut down most of the country. The president’s determination to wipe out perceived treachery underscores his intense distrust of the government that he oversees at a time when he is relying on career public health and emergency management officials to help guide him through one of the most dangerous periods in modern American history.”BIDEN SAYS HE’LL BE THE MASKED CANDIDATEFox News: “Add personally wearing face masks to the already large list of areas where President Trump and Joe Biden disagree. The president – in announcing that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended Americans wear facial coverings made of cloth while out in public to help stop the spread of the coronavirus pandemic – repeatedly called the recommendation ‘voluntary’ and said he wouldn’t be wearing a mask himself. ‘You don't have to do it,’ the president said on Friday. ‘I'm choosing not to do it, but some people may want to do it and that's OK. It may be good. Probably will.’ … Biden, the former vice president and likely Democratic presidential nominee, said he would wear a mask in public when asked during an interview on ABC’s ‘This Week.’ … Biden added, ‘he may not like how he looks in a mask but the truth of the matter is that -- follow the science.’”Giuliani a big booster for Trump’s pet malaria drug - WaPo: “Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was in the center of the impeachment storm earlier this year as an unpaid private attorney for President Trump, has cast himself in a new role: as personal science adviser to a president eager to find ways to short-circuit the coronavirus pandemic. In one-on-one phone calls with Trump, Giuliani said, he has been touting the use of an anti-malarial drug combination that has shown some early promise in treating covid-19, the disease the novel coronavirus causes, but whose effectiveness has not yet been proved. He said he now spends his days on the phone with doctors, coronavirus patients and hospital executives promoting the treatment, which Trump has also publicly lauded. ‘I discussed it with the president after he talked about it,’ Giuliani said in an interview. ‘I told him what I had on the drugs.’”Carney: ‘Dr. Fauci was correct -- more importantly, he was humble.’ -  WashEx: “In certain political circles, it has apparently become important to knock Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. … So, no, Fauci wasn’t predicting a pandemic. But he also wasn't saying there would be no pandemic. He was expressing uncertainty about a new and mysterious disease, and warning that it could become really bad. Everybody is wrong sometimes. The key is that when we speak about the future, especially, we should acknowledge the possibility we may be wrong.”PLAY-BY-PLAYHow a history book got George W.

I was not alive during FDR's terms, but believe his team had to confront challenges most similar to those that confront us today. That said, I don't believe his team had to confront as deep political divides as we face today.  Am I current on that? I have great respect for Reagan, Baker and O'Neil as individuals and how they worked together to kill inflation (with Volker's help) and address a very deep recession. The political divide between Tip and Ronald was huge, but they made it seem entirely manageable through their maturity, humanity and sense of humor.

I do not make this decision lightly.’ In a curious moment, though, Sanders said that Biden ‘will be the nominee,’ yet went on to stress the importance of continuing to win delegates for his own campaign so he'll be able to exert ‘influence’ on the party platform.

Some poll workers wore hazmat suits. Nearly every voter wore a face mask, removing it only to make small talk that reflected a combination of determination and grim humor about the extraordinary experience of voting amid a deadly pandemic. … Like so much else in Wisconsin, the scene was markedly different outside the main urban areas. Republican county chairs boasted about their smooth process throughout the day, with short lines and ample room for a smattering of voters who often showed little signs of the current health crisis — no masks, no gloves. … But in Milwaukee, where there are more than 1,000 confirmed cases of the virus and at least 87 people have died of it, many voters cast their ballots wearing full protective gear, some overtaken with fear.”Trump denounces voting by mail - Fox News: “President Trump is turning up the volume in his opposition to expanding voting by mail and absentee ballots as a way to minimize health risks posed by voting in-person during the coronavirus pandemic. ‘Mail-in voting is horrible. It's corrupt,’ the president argued during Tuesday’s daily Coronavirus Task Force press briefing at the White House. Trump then suggested that ‘you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in someone's living room signing ballots all over the place…I think that mail-in voting is a terrible thing.’ The president didn’t offer any evidence to back up his claim that voting by mail is rampant with fraud and abuse. The president’s comments follow a similar attack on voting by mail at Friday’s briefing, when he charged that ‘a lot of people cheat with mail-in voting.’”Ballot fight headed to battleground Florida -  Politico: “Election supervisors in Florida warned Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday that he needs to change the law to give them more flexibility to avoid a presidential election meltdown in the nation’s biggest swing state. The county officials — who issued the red alert on the same day Wisconsin held a disastrous primary amid widespread fears and irregularities due to the coronavirus — said the changes are needed to accommodate more absentee ballot voters, who could be scared away from the polls if the coronavirus outbreak persists into the August primary or the November general election. ‘Florida is not in a position, at this time, to conduct an all-mail ballot election this year,’ Tammy Jones, supervisor for Levy County and the president of the Florida Supervisors of Elections, wrote DeSantis in a letter sent Tuesday on behalf of the 67 officials who run elections in the state.”POLL SHOWS MASSIVE ECONOMIC DAMAGECNBC: “A quarter of  Americans have either lost their job or seen their wages cut as a result of the coronavirus shutdown, according to the CNBC All-America Economic Survey, which registered the biggest and fastest decline ever in the public’s view of the economy. At the same time, it found that a majority of Americans remains optimistic that the economy will bounce back in the next year, and President Donald Trump’s approval rating has improved. … Nine percent believe unemployment or a pay cut await them. The poll has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points. The percentage of Americans saying the economy is now good or excellent fell to just 22%, giving up the gains of the Trump presidency, and falling further than it ever did after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks or the Great Recession in 2008.”Voters souring on federal response - CNN: “A majority of Americans -- 55% -- now say the federal government has done a poor job preventing the spread of coronavirus in the United States, up eight points in about a week, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS as the nationwide death toll from the virus rose above 12,000. Eighty percent feel the worst of the outbreak is yet to come, most (55%) feel President Donald Trump could be doing more to fight the outbreak, and 37% say they have grown more concerned about coronavirus in the last few days, far outpacing the 5% who say their fears have eased recently. About 1 in 5 (22%) say they personally know someone who has been diagnosed with the virus, a figure that is double the share who said so in a Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted just two weeks ago.

I happen to believe when Team Red won the House in '94 began the beginning of today's bitter divide between parties. For 40 years prior Team Blue was in charge, including during the Reagan years. In November 1994 the country chose a different direction for the House which, in turn, upset more Democrats and media folks than all of the events in the 80's and prior. I remember ABC's Peter Jennings on election night referring to American voters as having, ‘thrown their temper tantrum’ by switching the House. Four years later Republicans, to their detriment in my opinion, impeached President Clinton. ... Today's ugly partisanship didn't start with Jimmy Carter winning the '76 Democratic primary nor is it likely to get better soon, primaries or not, sadly.” – Mark Hoffman, Des Moines, Iowa[Ed. note: I’m not blaming Iowa, Mr. Hoffman! Party leaders there were acting out of rational self-interest in seeking to make their state more influential. The move toward primaries and caucuses was happening far beyond Iowa’s 99-counties. I think you’ve certainly identified the time period in which things turned so sharply, but you might give some thought to causation. Remember that the media landscape was totally transformed in the mid- to late-1990s. How Americans got news and information began a change not seen in the West maybe since the printing press. Look also at migration and population patterns. The great shift southwest really got going in those days, which brought big changes in political power dynamics. Basically, America became a very well-sorted place politically. The liberal Republicans and the conservative Democrats got squeezed out and our politics became much more nationalized and ideological. Politics had been a lot about the art of persuasion and finding coalitions. But it became hard arithmetic. The introduction of widespread primary voting 20 years ago not only helped drive those trends, but those trends amplified the pernicious effects of government-run nominating contests.]“[You] barely tipped the top of the iceberg when it comes to the Cheese State's dysfunctional government.  It goes all the way down to the local entities, towns and schools. I live in rural Wisconsin where people are voted in for life. Many seats go unfilled for years because nobody wants to get ‘involved.’  We are used to Madison/Dane County and Milwaukee County pushing their progressive ideas on the rest of the conservative state. I guess time will tell how this will turn out but one thing is for sure: as soon as the polls close tonight, someone, somewhere, will be gearing up to contest the results. Sad but true.” – Terri Reynolds, Monroe, Wis.[Ed. note: I’ll let the irreplaceable Charles Krauthammer handle this one with a line from his book “Things That Matter”: “You can have the most advanced and efflorescent of cultures. Get your politics wrong, however, and everything stands to be swept away. . . . Politics is the moat, the walls, beyond which lie the barbarians.”]“My compliments on your writeup on Wisconsin and on the write up of Al Kaline’s passing. Growing up across the lake over in Michigan, we got to watch Wisconsin try and figure it out one election at a time and we got to enjoy listening to the Tigers on AM radio.  I only heard the later years of Kaline’s career, but I remember my mom would turn on the old AM radio and I would watch the tubes warm up and glow with the sound slowly growing.  We would then listen to the great Ernie Harwell and later the team of Ernie Harwell and Paul Carey give the play by play and color on WJR AM 760. They would talk about every pitch and you just felt like you were there. There are certain aspects of youth that bring back good memories. Listening to the Tigers, Kaline, with Ernie and Paul is a welcome memory in this crazy quarantined time.  Thank you for jogging it.” – Peter Eick, Boerne, Texas[Ed. note: Lovely, Mr. Eick.

Throughout his 20 years umpiring in the minor and major leagues, he was almost always the only black umpire on the field, and was sometimes subjected to racial epithets. But Ashford weathered these with grace. Today, the Spalding face mask he wore behind the plate is a tangible reminder of the courageous men and women who integrated U.S. sports after World War II. Still, only ten African-Americans have followed directly in Ashford’s footsteps, and it wasn’t until this past February that Major League Baseball hired its first black umpire crew chief, Kerwin Danley. … Ashford’s entry into umpiring was largely accidental. … For one game in 1941, the story goes, the scheduled umpire didn’t show up, and Ashford was asked to fill in. … One game led to another, and he soon established himself as a better umpire than ballplayer.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCEAverage approval: 46 percentAverage disapproval: 49.2 percentNet Score: -3.2 pointsChange from one week ago: ↓ 0.2 points[Average includes: NBC News/WSJ: 46% approve - 51% disapprove; Gallup: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; Fox News: 49% approve - 49% disapprove; Monmouth University: 46% approve - 49% disapprove; CNBC: 46% approve - 43% disapprove.] WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT? You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

The legislation that the House will take up, which passed the Senate Tuesday, includes $320 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, designed to help struggling small businesses keep their workers on the payroll. It’s widely regarded as an interim step as the coronavirus pandemic continues to cause death and economic havoc. ‘We’re ready to go on to the next bill,’ House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday morning on MSNBC. Both parties are looking at follow-up legislation that would be more comprehensive and costly. President Donald Trump, who met Tuesday with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, said aid to state and local governments would be part of a so-called phase four stimulus, as would money for road projects and expanding broadband service.”McConnell pumps the brakes on next one - Politico: “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is drawing a line: There will be no more attempts at long-distance legislating on the coronavirus. In a telephone interview Tuesday after passage of a $484 billion coronavirus relief bill, the Senate majority leader made clear that the full Senate must be in session before Congress begins its fifth installment of responding to the pandemic. And he signaled he is growing weary of quickly shoveling billions of dollars out the door even as the economy continues to crater. The latest measure cleared the Senate by voice vote, but it was the product of days of fraught negotiations and false starts — and its success will be difficult to replicate as senators' frustrations over the extended recess pile up. McConnell said the Senate will proceed ‘cautiously’ to the next phase of coronavirus relief despite rapidly escalating demands for more aid from members of both parties. And he said that all 100 senators need to be around before Washington spends more money on an unprecedented economic rescue of workers and businesses caught in the virus’ fallout.”Some Senate Republicans buck Trump on testing - WaPo: “Congressional Republicans have strongly backed President Trump’s efforts to respond to the deadly coronavirus pandemic and its crippling impact on the economy… But on the issue of testing, some Senate Republicans are looking for ways to get the federal government to play a bigger role despite Trump’s insistence it is an issue that governors should handle. Led by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Senate Republicans have largely envisioned the federal government taking a lead role in experimenting with diagnostic and serological tests for the coronavirus, even if some of the ideas ultimately fail — the thinking being that the government can take chances that perhaps the private sector cannot. ‘We’re encouraging some risk-taking here,’ Blunt said in an interview Tuesday. There is about $1 billion allocated for that effort in the a $484 billion economic stimulus agreement that cleared the Senate on Tuesday afternoon.”Pelosi sidelines plan for proxy voting after GOP backlash - Fox News: “House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has temporarily sidelined a push to allow proxy voting in the House after Republicans slammed the Democrat-crafted plan -- which was designed to mitigate health risks during the coronavirus pandemic but would mark a significant change in how Congress does business. The plan had been slated for a vote Thursday. But Pelosi pulled the plug on a leadership call Wednesday, saying that she and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., would instead set up a group of bipartisan lawmakers to study remote voting and proxy voting as part of a way to reopen the House. … The change of plans happened after House Minority Whip Steve Scalise advised GOP members to vote ‘no’ on the proposal they've dubbed the ‘Pelosi Proxy Voting Scheme’ in the previously scheduled Thursday vote.”CDC director warns of second wave - WaPo: “Even as states move ahead with plans to reopen their economies, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Tuesday that a second wave of the novel coronavirus will be far more dire because it is likely to coincide with the start of flu season. … CDC Director Robert Redfield said in an interview with The Washington Post. … ‘We’re going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time,’ he said. Having two simultaneous respiratory outbreaks would put unimaginable strain on the health-care system, he said. The first wave of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has already killed more than 42,000 people across the country. It has overwhelmed hospitals and revealed gaping shortages in test kits, ventilators and protective equipment for health-care workers.”Barr: DOJ may side with citizens who sue states over 'onerous' coronavirus restrictions - Fox News: “Attorney General Bill Barr took a clear swipe Tuesday at state restrictions on citizens during the coronavirus pandemic, indicating not only that people could sue over measures that go too far but that the Justice Department could end up siding with them against the states. In [a radio interview], Barr specified some of the legal issues raised by state orders – likening some to ‘house arrest’ – and how they could lead the federal government to get involved. ‘Our federal constitutional rights don’t go away in an emergency. They constrain what the government can do,’ Barr said in the Tuesday interview. … The attorney general warned that while some state orders may still be necessary, others may go too far, given that states are seeing progress toward the goal of reducing the spread of the virus.”CORONAVIRUS REMAKES 2020 MAP Politico: “The economic and political impact of the coronavirus crisis is beginning to reverberate across the presidential battleground states, creating unforeseen red-state opportunities for Joe Biden but also offering promise for Donald Trump in several Democratic-leaning states where his prospects once seemed limited. Interviews with more than 30 political strategists, campaign advisers and officials in both parties paint a portrait of an expanded swing state electoral map, upended by the coronavirus pandemic and the economic dislocation it has caused. In the industrial Midwestern states that unexpectedly flipped to Trump in 2016, Democrats have more cause than ever to believe they can win back states such as Wisconsin and Michigan. In Arizona and Georgia, traditionally red states, party officials see the virus’ disproportionate effect on communities of color enhancing conditions for victory. At the same time, the widespread disruption has presented the president with an opportunity to improve his standing in competitive states such as Nevada and New Hampshire, where Trump was presumed to be at a slight disadvantage.”It could delay 2020 results, too - Yahoo News: “Americans have come to expect that they will know who their next president is on election night, but that’s likely to change this fall. In fact, because of a huge increase in mail-in voting in states that are not used to it, the presidential election could take a week or more to be decided. Public officials and advocates are just now beginning to grapple with how to prepare themselves, and the country, for this unprecedented situation. ‘It’s a culture shift that’s going to be required,’ said Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, in an interview. … Gupta, who oversaw the Justice Department’s civil rights division from 2014 to 2017, said her organization — one of the oldest civil rights groups in the country — would work with other groups over the next several months to raise awareness and create an expectation among both voters and journalists that results should not be expected on election night.”Biden campaign leaders clash on how to handle digital operations - Politico: “Joe Biden’s campaign leadership is clashing over the future of its digital operation — a rift that comes as campaigning has moved largely online and as Biden faces a yawning deficit against President Donald Trump’s massive digital operation. The disagreement among Biden’s top advisers centers on whether to hire most of its digital team internally or to rely on the firm Hawkfish, which is backed financially by billionaire Mike Bloomberg and ran the digital operation for his presidential campaign. The outcome of the internal battle will have far-reaching consequences for November as the coronavirus pandemic has made traditional campaigning — rallies with crowds and get-out-the-vote efforts like door knocking — all but impossible, while pushing digital campaigning to the forefront. Trump’s digital presence is significantly larger than Biden’s on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, a disadvantage that has made the discussions even more urgent.”Biden to announce selection panel for veep by May 1 - WaPo: “Former vice president Joe Biden said he intends to name a panel of advisers by May 1 to help him select a running mate, offering the nugget early Wednesday via an appearance on ‘The Late Late Show with James Corden.’ Announcing the committee would officially launch Biden’s search for a vice presidential candidate, a process that has already informally begun with allies of contenders making their case to Biden’s advisers. Biden has said that he will select a woman for the role and that he expects to whittle down the list of contenders to two or three by July. … ‘The first, the most important quality is someone who — if I walked away immediately from the office for whatever reason — that they can be president,’ Biden said.”TRUMP WANTS TO HIT THE CAMPAIGN TRAILPolitico: “As his own health officials continue to warn against non-essential travel, Trump has privately urged aides over the past week to start adding official events back to his schedule, including photo ops and site visits that would allow him to ditch Washington for a few hours. The day trips would be similar to those Vice President Mike Pence has made visiting businesses during the viral pandemic, according to three people familiar with the planning. … The president has otherwise stayed within the executive complex for six weeks, an extraordinary stretch of confinement for a president who — even while stuck in Washington — loves to golf and visit his businesses. … The first step of the administration’s ‘Opening Up America Again’ strategy maintains restrictions on small gatherings if physical distancing measures cannot be adhered to and discourages Americans from pursuing non-essential travel, setting Trump on a potential collision course with swing-state governors who are reluctant to host him or presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden for official or political events in the near future.”Trump campaign capitalizes on digital post-briefing shows - ABC News: “After nearly two hours last Wednesday, President Donald Trump walked away from the podium following another White House coronavirus briefing. Seconds later, his campaign’s digital operation went live with its online show. … It's a virtual hand-off between the president and his campaign that's become routine each night. As the perpetual daily press briefings continue, Trump's re-election team has found a way to capitalize on the attention generated online from the briefings by strategically airing nighty digital events that effectively serve as a post-game show for the president’s loyal base. … And like Trump’s now-daily press briefings, which have reached ‘Bachelor Finale’ ratings as the president often points out … the president's campaign’s daily shows also rake in big numbers thanks to the team’s large digital operation—averaging about 1 million views each between streams on platforms like Twitter, YouTube, Twitch, and MIXER, and Facebook, according to the campaign.”PLAY-BY-PLAYBernie bros fight to keep Sanders on New York ballot - HuffPoMcConnell says 'pandemic will not prevent' confirmation of judges - Fox NewsAUDIBLE: SORRY BERNIE“I think people are realizing, ‘My Lord. Look at what is possible. Look at the institutional changes we can make – without us becoming a ‘socialist country,’ or any of that malarkey – that we can make to provide the opportunities to change the institutional drawbacks ...’ from education, all the way through to all the other things we talked about.” – Former Vice President Joe Biden speaking to donors at a virtual fundraiser.FROM THE BLEACHERS“I noticed in the ‘From the Bleachers’ section [Tuesday and Monday] that you recommended reducing the number of congressional staffers. Would you mind expanding on this a bit? My experience of Capitol Hill is that the personal staff of most members is made of up a rotating cast of twenty-somethings who are trying their best but just don't have the education or professional experience to adequately advise their members on the issues that come before them. Reducing a staff that is already stretched thin and ill-equipped to do their jobs seems to me like just another way for Congress to put itself at a disadvantage relative to the executive branch. But I am genuinely interested in hearing why I am wrong!  I would also like to thank you and Brianna for the work you do every day.

It was a day to walk around the property lines and assess your land for the summer season, to mend fences. Women washed their faces with the spring dew so that they would stay beautiful, and there was dancing, tournaments, parades, feasting, and general revelry. … May trees, or Maypoles, were set up covered in rowan or hawthorn flowers as a blessing… and villages would compete with each other to see who could produce the tallest maypole. Young couples went off into the forest to spend the night together and came back the next day with flowers to spread through the village. A young woman was crowned May Queen, and she would ride naked on horseback through the village.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCEAverage approval: 45 percentAverage disapproval: 49.8 percentNet Score: -4.8 pointsChange from one week ago: ↓ 1.6 points[Average includes: PRRI: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; IBD: 44% approve - 44% disapprove; Gallup: 49% approve - 47% disapprove; USA Today/Suffolk University: 43% approve - 53% disapprove; NBC News/WSJ: 46% approve - 51% disapprove.] WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

This never happened,’ Biden said in a written statement put out by his campaign. ‘While the details of these allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault are complicated, two things are not complicated. One is that women deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced. The second is that their stories should be subject to appropriate inquiry and scrutiny.’ Further, Biden called for the secretary of the Senate to ask the National Archives to ‘identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document.’”Biden OKs Archives search, not personal papers - Fox News: “Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Friday called for a search of the National Archives for any records that might pertain to allegations made against him by former Senate aide Tara Reade — but refused to approve a similar search of his senatorial papers, which are currently stored at the University of Delaware and sealed from the public. … But Biden, in the interview, was pressed on his refusal to approve a similar search of a massive trove of papers from his three-plus decades in the Senate that he donated years ago to the University of Delaware. Biden maintained that the trove would not contain personnel files. ‘There is nothing, they're not there ... The material in the University of Delaware has no personnel files ... but it does have a lot of confidential conversations’ with other officials, like the president and foreign dignitaries, Biden said.”Susan Page: Biden's denial was unequivocal. That doesn't mean he's put this issue to rest. - USA Today: “In the interview, Biden needed to tackle the accusations personally and directly. He did that, in words that left him no wiggle room – stating flatly that it didn't happen, not that he didn't recall, or that this might the result of some sort of misunderstanding. His request to the secretary of the Senate to order a search of his personnel records conveyed his confidence that he had nothing to hide. Biden also needed to square his denials with the standards of the #MeToo movement, including the assertion by some that women who come forward with accusations of harassment deserve to be believed. … Fairly or not, her allegations carry particular peril for Biden because his brand is empathy.”STATES MOVE TO REOPEN, BUT SLOWLYFox News: “America is slowly but surely reopening for business. The start of May saw more than a dozen states relaxing lockdown measures that were imposed as the coronavirus pandemic began spiraling out of control on U.S. soil. As of Friday morning, the U.S. had more than a million coronavirus cases and more than 63,000 deaths. President Trump announced a plan on April 16 to reopen the country in three phases, based on the severity of the outbreak in each state or region. And several states believe they meet the criteria to get the ball rolling after a month of shuttered shops, restaurants and people cooped up at home. While states like Georgia, Oklahoma and Tennessee began relaxing rules earlier in the week, these states followed suit as of Friday to varying degrees: [Alabama, Arizona, Idaho, Illinois , Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Wyoming.]”Labor groups seek May Day shutdown of essential businesses - NPR: “Employees at many online retailers, grocery store chains and package-delivery services are planning labor actions Friday to protest what they describe as unsafe working conditions amid the COVID-19 pandemic, while others, put out of work by the disease, are using May Day to demand an end to stay-at-home orders they say are ruining livelihoods and irreparably harming the economy. Meanwhile, nurses at scores of hospitals across the country plan to take to the streets to protest a lack of personal protective equipment; and independent truckers, fed up with low freight rates, plan a congestion-inducing ‘slow roll’ in their rigs through parts of Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington and other major cities. The May Day protests come as the country is on edge, with more than 1 million confirmed infections and some 63,000 deaths attributed to COVID-19 and after weeks of stay-at-home orders that have put a fifth of the nation's workforce out of a job, while employees deemed essential risk exposure to the novel coronavirus just by showing up to work.”GOP lawmakers, Whitmer clash over Michigan’s virus order - AP: “The Republican-led Michigan Legislature refused Thursday to extend the state’s coronavirus emergency declaration and voted to authorize a lawsuit challenging Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s authority and actions to combat the pandemic. The governor, unfazed, responded with orders stating under one law that an emergency still exists, while declaring a new 28-day state of emergency under another law. The declarations are important because they are the foundation for Whitmer’s stay-at-home measure, which will remain in effect through May 15, and other directives aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. … Whitmer accused GOP lawmakers of ‘putting their heads in the sand and putting more lives and livelihoods at risk. I’m not going to let that happen.’ The legislative pushback came as hundreds of conservative activists, including some who were openly carrying assault rifles, returned to the Capitol to denounce her stay-home order.”Questions mount over Trump son in law’s medical supply plan - Bloomberg: “A program created by Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner has airlifted millions of gloves, masks and other coveted coronavirus supplies into the U.S. from overseas -- but it isn’t clear who’s getting them and at what price, or how much private-sector partners are earning through the arrangement. Kushner’s ‘Project Airbridge’ provides transportation via FedEx Corp. and others for supplies that medical distributors, including McKesson Corp. and Cardinal Health Inc., buy from overseas manufacturers, mainly in China. Once a supplier’s goods arrive in the U.S., the companies must sell half the order in government-designated hotspots. They sell the rest as they see fit. The U.S. government provides the air transportation for free, to speed the arrival of the products. The six distributors keep the profits, if any.”HOUSE DEMS SEEK $1 TRILLION FOR STATES, CITIESBloomberg: “House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday states and cities alone are seeking as much as $1 trillion in aid in the next coronavirus relief package, a figure that may be tough to reach as Congress juggles demands to bolster the economy. Pelosi said state governments are still finalizing their request but have so far sought $500 billion, while local governments have a similar figure. Lawmakers also are considering other proposals including another round of cash payments to taxpayers, expanded unemployment insurance, assistance to renters and wider broadband access. ‘State and local, I talked about almost $1 trillion right there,’ Pelosi said at her weekly news conference. ‘We are not going to be able to cover all of it, but to the extent we can keep the states and localities sustainable, that is our goal.’”Dems’ push for broadband expansion gains traction - Roll Call: “House Democrats on Thursday renewed their push for an $86 billion broadband expansion, arguing that if the coronavirus pandemic stretches into next fall, students without internet access risk being left behind if schools remain closed. Party leaders said some of the broadband and distance learning money could be tacked onto the next round of COVID-19 relief, which House Democrats are in the process of assembling. ‘If we are going to experience ... another round of this virus, our children are apt to be out of school again next year,’ said House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn, D-S.C., who is chairman of the House Democratic Rural Broadband Task Force. ‘And if that were to happen, the only way you can have online learning is with broadband.’ … Democrats appear likely to see support from across the aisle. Speaking hours later, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy acknowledged that ‘broadband is a very good discussion,’ as part of the next pandemic relief package.”Test shortage means not all Senators can be swabbed - Politico: “The Capitol’s attending physician said Thursday that coronavirus tests will be available for staffers and senators who are ill, but not enough to proactively test all 100 senators as the chamber comes back in session, according to two people familiar with the matter. In a conference call with top GOP officials, Dr. Brian Monahan said there is not sufficient capacity to quickly test senators for coronavirus — a contrast with the White House, where any people meeting with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are tested for the disease. Monahan said test results in the Senate will take two or more days, while the White House has rapid testing. The Senate is scheduled to reconvene on Monday after more than a month away, bringing as many as 100 senators from across the country. Roughly half the senators are 65 or older and at increased risk for the coronavirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.”PLAY-BY-PLAYBig money donors are pressuring Biden to not pick Warren for VP - CNBCGOP begin considering convention changes - NBC NewsResults of internal poll have Georgia Republicans worried about 2020 - AJCFormer Rep. Katie Hill gets involved with special election for her seat with ad, PAC funding - PoliticoDelta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines begin mandating passenger face masks - PoliticoAUDIBLE: OKAY THEN“I don’t need a lecture or a speech.” – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s response to a reporter who asked Pelosi whether Democrats had a different “standard” for Biden than for Kavanaugh.ANY GIVEN SUNDAYWatch “Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace.” Check local listings for broadcast times in your area.#mediabuzz - Host Howard Kurtz has the latest take on the week’s media coverage.

Where is the outrage?” – Don Sanislo, Auburn, Wash.[Ed. note: I assume you are referring here to edicts in California, New York and New Jersey intended to protect the younger, healthier members of the population but that appear to consign the elderly to a grim fate. I don’t know enough about the risks and considerations to answer your question. But I do think historians may one day look back at American history since the Second World War as a history of our struggle with health care. As science and technology have allowed us to defy history and increase the life expectancy for Americans by nearly 50 percent, we have been ill-equipped ethically, economically and culturally for the change. And since there’s nothing Americans hate talking about quite as much as aging and death, these questions -- and very often the elderly themselves -- get ignored. As we contemplate things that will be different in a world more aware of the dangers of infectious disease, I certainly pray that one of those things will be about how we treat the elderly. Not every family and not every patient is suitable for caring for at home, but I can certainly foresee an acceleration of our already encouraging return to an earlier model of multi-generational family households.]“Perhaps I’m being too cynical, but it looks like the upcoming presidential election will pit an unapologetic narcissist against a semi- senile sex offender.  In a country of over 300 million people, is that the best we can do?  Thanks for your daily newsletter, it makes me feel better informed.” – Jim May, San Diego[Ed. note: I’m not sure which candidate you think is which in this scenario, Mr. May, but I’m sure many Americans would agree with your sentiment whichever way you played it. I often marvel at the fact that anyone other than hardcore partisans vote at all. I have joked that our current political process is like two guys micturating in a pool and then asking voters to join them for a swim.]Share your color commentary: Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM and please make sure to include your name and hometown.SAMEQuartz: “While animals all around the world have relished the chance to reclaim land as humans recede into their homes during the pandemic, one Japanese aquarium says that the lack of people is actually posing a problem for animals in captivity, specifically eels. The Sumida Aquarium, which is housed in the Tokyo Skytree tower, noticed that its hundreds of tiny spotted garden eels have started acting oddly, such as burrowing into the sand when aquarium workers pass by the tank. … In response, the aquarium is launching a three-day ‘emergency event’ starting on May 3, known as the ‘face-showing festival,’ with the goal of ‘not forgetting the existence of humans.’ It is inviting people to call the aquarium’s dedicated account through an iPad or iPhone, and once connected, people are asked to wave or call out to the eels (but not too loudly) for five minutes at a time, during two time slots a day.”AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES…“My very best friend.

The projections, based on modeling by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and pulled together in chart form by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, forecast about 200,000 new cases each day by the end of the month, up from about 25,000 cases now. … ‘While mitigation didn’t fail, I think it’s fair to say that it didn’t work as well as we expected,’ Scott Gottlieb, Mr. Trump’s former commissioner of food and drugs, said [to CBS News]. ‘We expected that we would start seeing more significant declines in new cases and deaths around the nation at this point.’”Trump nudges up expected death toll, vows more relief spending - Bloomberg: “President Donald Trump promised more federal help for Americans left jobless by by the pandemic and vowed to press ahead with reopening the economy, addressing the nation in a televised town hall event at the Lincoln Memorial as coronavirus cases and deaths continue to mount. In the opening minutes of the event, broadcast by Fox News, Trump revised upward the number of Americans he expects to be killed by the virus. ‘We’re going to lose anywhere between 75, 80 to 100,000,’ he said. He had said in April he hoped deaths would total less than 60,000; the number of dead so far is more than 67,000. 'Now we have to get it back open,' Trump said, addressing the economic fallout of the shutdown. Trump’s first question, by video, came from an Alabama woman who said she had been unable to apply for unemployment, hadn’t received a federal stimulus check and was feeding her family on donations. ‘There’s more help coming,’ Trump said.”Promises vaccine: ‘you’re going to have it by the end of the year’ - National Review: “President Donald Trump stated that he is ‘very confident’ the U.S. will discover a coronavirus vaccine in the next seven months, following news that his administration has organized a ‘Manhattan Program-esque’ project to fast-track development. ‘We are very confident that we’re going to have a vaccine at the end of the year, by the end of the year,’ Trump told Fox News during a town hall on Sunday night. ‘We think we’re going to have a vaccine by the end of this year. We’re pushing very hard.’ … Pharmaceutical companies, the government, and the military are pooling their efforts, with the goal of 300 million vaccine doses available for Americans by the start of 2021. Experts have been bearish on the prospects of a vaccine in 2020, with most predicting twelve to 18 months before one is widely available to the public.”At memorial to slain Lincoln, Trump says he’s had it worse - WaPo: “Sitting inside the cavernous Lincoln Memorial on Sunday for Fox News’s virtual town hall, President Donald Trump appeared to draw inspiration from his surroundings when asked about why he uses divisive language and dodges questions during White House coronavirus briefings. ‘I am greeted with a hostile press, the likes of which no president has ever seen. The closest would be that gentleman right up there,’ Trump said from his perch on a high-backed stool, pointing at the imposing marble statue of martyred president Abraham Lincoln in the background. Lincoln was assassinated in April, 1865. ‘They always said, ‘Lincoln, nobody got treated worse than Lincoln,’’ Trump continued. ‘I believe I am treated worse.’”Pence regrets not wearing mask - Politico: “Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday said that he should have worn a mask when visiting the Mayo Clinic, a reversal that came after a harsh backlash for not adhering to the hospital’s policy during the coronavirus pandemic. ‘I didn't think it was necessary, but I should have worn a mask at the Mayo Clinic and I wore it when I visited the ventilator plant in Indiana’ two days later, Pence said at a Fox News virtual town hall on Sunday, nodding sheepishly. Pence on Tuesday toured the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., where he met with hospital staff and a patient. According to reporters who were there, every other person present wore a mask. The vice president has said since he is constantly tested for coronavirus and since the mask prevents people from transmitting the virus, he didn’t believe he had to wear one. He reiterated that belief at Sunday’s town hall.”Small businesses collapsing - The Atlantic: “The government is engaged in an unprecedented effort to save such companies as pandemic-related shutdowns stretch into the spring. But Washington’s policies are too complicated, too small, and too slow for many firms: Across the United States, millions of small businesses are struggling, and millions are failing. The great small-business die-off is here, and it will change the landscape of American commerce, auguring slower growth and less innovation in the future. Small businesses went into this recession more fragile than their larger cousins: Before the crisis hit, half of them had less than two weeks’ worth of cash on hand, making it impossible to cover rent, insurance, utilities, and payroll through any kind of sustained downturn. And the coronavirus downturn has indeed been shocking and sustained: Data from credit-card processors suggest that roughly 30 percent of small businesses have shut down during the pandemic.”THE RULEBOOK: THANKS GUYS“The history of Great Britain is the one with which we are in general the best acquainted, and it gives us many useful lessons.

It’s fun and funny.’ Though he got in a dig at the plot — ‘the story of ‘Star Wars’ could be written on the head of a pin and still leave room for the Bible’ — Canby complimented Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford (as Luke, Leia and Han Solo), noting that ‘everyone treats his material with the proper combination of solemnity and good humor that avoids condescension’…”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCEAverage approval: 45 percentAverage disapproval: 49.8 percentNet Score: -4.8 pointsChange from one week ago: ↓ 1.6 points[Average includes: PRRI: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; IBD: 44% approve - 44% disapprove; Gallup: 49% approve - 47% disapprove; USA Today/Suffolk University: 43% approve - 53% disapprove; NBC News/WSJ: 46% approve - 51% disapprove.] WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

While the coronavirus has tossed the mechanics of politicking in flux for the foreseeable future, leaders in both parties and officials with President Donald Trump and Joe Biden’s campaigns are surveying a relatively stable political battlefield that will be concentrated largely in just about a half dozen states: the former ‘blue wall’ states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the traditional swing states of Florida and North Carolina, and the emerging battleground of Arizona. The common thread among these six states at the center of the general election map is that they were all carried by Trump in 2016, and that the president currently trails in many of the early polls there, leaving him mostly on defense heading into November.”Kraushaar: Republicans look for safe space from Trump - National Journal: “Here are some staples of the GOP’s pre-pandemic thinking: Republicans should embrace the president at all costs, even in swing states where his job approval is underwater. It’s more important to rally the base than persuade swing suburbanites. With Republicans defending most of their Senate seats in Trump territory, simply holding the president’s voters would be adequate to maintain Mitch McConnell’s majority. Here’s what I’m hearing from smart GOP strategists now: Republicans should be talking about their work to help their communities in the wake of the pandemic, and avoid referencing President Trump’s role in managing the crisis. To win battleground Senate seats that are looking more tenuous, it will be crucial to maintain support from some Trump-skeptical independents. If Trump’s political condition doesn’t improve by the fall, prepare to talk about keeping the Senate as a check against Democratic power, even if it means acknowledging the presidency is likely lost.”SENATE CAN’T COMPLY WITH BIDEN PROBE REQUESTFox News: “The secretary of the Senate on Monday said her office cannot comply with a request by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to order a search for a purported complaint made by the woman accusing him of sexual assault when he was a senator. … That statement from Biden tipped off confusion and speculation on who exactly controls documents from the Fair Employment Office. The National Archives issued a statement claiming that a Fair Employment Office complaint ‘would have remained under the control of the Senate.’ It did not, however, deny that the complaint could physically be in its possession but legally under the control of the Senate. [Julie] Adams' Monday statement did not deny that the complaint might exist or that it could be at the National Archives. It said that she would not be able to release the complaint if it does exist because of a law that ensures the confidentiality of such complaints.”Axelrod says veep vetting didn’t uncover assault claim - Fox News: “Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said over the weekend that the sexual assault allegation leveled against Joe Biden did not come up in 2008 during the Obama campaign’s vetting process for their eventual vice presidential pick. Axelrod, who was the chief strategist for the campaign and later a White House senior adviser to former President Barack Obama, said that Biden was carefully vetted before being announced as Obama’s running mate and that nothing surfaced to cause concern, including this. ‘Before @JoeBiden was selected VP by @BarackObama, letters for the campaign scoured every aspect of his record, career and life,’ Axelrod tweeted this weekend. ‘Tara Reade or complaints of sexual harassment or assault never came up.’ He added: ‘I know. I was there.’”Axelrod and Plouffe: What Joe Biden needs to do to beat Trump - NYT: “Adjusting to the new political realities is imperative for Mr. Biden, who ran his first campaign for office a half-century ago. In order to break through and be heard, he will have to up the tempo of his campaign, fully utilize his army of powerful surrogates and embrace a new suite of virtual, data-driven tools and creative tactics. … For Mr. Biden, the challenge is to transform a campaign that lagged behind many of his Democratic competitors during the primary in its use of digital media and timely, state-of-the-art communications techniques. While television remains a potent force, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok are all essential in a Covid-19 world in which candidate travel and voter contact will be severely limited. In many respects, they are the campaign, not an important part of it.”SENATE GETS UNDERWAY WITH TIGHT RESTRICTIONSFox News: “The U.S. Senate returns in earnest Monday for the first time since March 25, with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell calling lawmakers back to Washington amid enhanced precautions due to the coronavirus. Congress has been largely out due to the pandemic, except for limited sessions with skeleton crews. The House remains out, with leaders having announced they will not be back this week, though they will have a committee hearing on COVID-19 response. Senate leaders are expected to deliver remarks on the floor late Monday afternoon, with an evening vote on the confirmation of Robert Feitel to serve on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Senators are expected to pop in, vote and leave to maintain social distancing. While senators themselves will be present, much of their staff is expected to continue working remotely. The Capitol Attending Physician issued guidance Friday recommending that their offices have as few people as necessary for the time being.”JUSTICE DEPARTMENT BACKS CHURCH IN CORONA SUITFox News: “The Justice Department is siding with a Virginia church suing Gov. Ralph Northam after police threatened a pastor with jail time or a $2,500 fine for violating the state's coronavirus lockdown restrictions by holding a 16-person church service on Palm Sunday. The DOJ decision came after police in protective garb served a summons to Kevin Wilson, the pastor of Lighthouse Fellowship Church on Chincoteague Island, for holding the service on April 5 with 16 people spaced far apart from one another in a church that could fit 293 people. … ‘The Commonwealth of Virginia has offered no good reason for refusing to trust congregants who promise to use care in worship in the same way it trusts accountants, lawyers, and other workers to do the same,’ the DOJ said in a statement…”PLAY-BY-PLAYTrump attacks George W.

Mr. Trump said the task force would be shut down and replaced with an unspecified new advisory body as the country moved into what he called Phase 2 of a response to a pandemic that has killed more than 71,000 Americans. ‘We will have something in a different form,’ Mr. Trump told reporters as he toured a Honeywell mask manufacturing plant in Arizona, where he wore safety goggles but no mask. The president praised the work of the task force, led by Vice President Mike Pence, but said it was time to focus on safety and reopening the country. Mr. Pence said the group would probably wrap up its work around the end of the May, and shift management of the public health response back to the federal agencies whose work it was created to coordinate.”Grumbles abound - Fox News: “Democrats were quick to condemn the Trump administration Tuesday following comments from Vice President Mike Pence that the White House is in talks to potentially wind down its coronavirus task force, transferring its responsibilities to agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as early as Memorial Day or early June. An official told Fox News that the members of the task force will continue to provide input, but the group will not be meeting as regularly as they had been at the outset of the pandemic. The official added that the White House’s focus was shifting toward vaccines, therapeutics, testing and reopening the economy. The voices panning the Trump administration's decision to work on transferring the task force's responsibilities came from governors' offices, activists and some members of Congress.”Coronavirus on the march in rural America - AP: “As the world’s attention was fixated on the horrors in Italy and New York City, the per capita death rates in counties in the impoverished southwest corner of Georgia climbed to among the worst in the country. The devastation here is a cautionary tale of what happens when the virus seeps into communities that have for generations remained on the losing end of the nation’s most intractable inequalities: these counties are rural, mostly African American and poor. … Rural people, African Americans and the poor are more likely to work in jobs not conducive to social distancing, like the food processing plant in nearby Mitchell County where four employees died of COVID-19. They have less access to health care and so more often delay treatment for chronic conditions; in southwest Georgia, the diabetes rate of 16 percent is twice as high as in Atlanta. Transportation alone can be a challenge, so that by the time they make it to the hospital, they’re harder to save.”Tracking state trends - Axios: “In addition to keeping an eye on the tragic, and climbing, numbers of total coronavirus cases and deaths across the U.S., it's important to watch how those trends are playing out over time at the state level. … The Trump administration's reopening guidelines detail that in order to start lifting restrictions and reopening the economy, a state needs to report 14-day trends of fewer cases or fewer positive tests... Not a lot of states meet that criteria. Our chart compares each state's seven-day average of new cases from Monday and the seven-day average from a week prior, April 27. … By this metric, Minnesota, Nebraska and Puerto Rico have the most worrisome trends, while Arkansas and Wyoming have the most positive trends. Twelve states are moving in the right direction. But more than a third of the nation still has growing numbers of cases. And that includes states such as Texas and Virginia, where Republican and Democratic governors are beginning to unveil re-opening plans. These trends only tell us so much.”Chamber of Commerce offers a roadmap for businesses - U.S. News and World Report: “The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is providing guidance for America's business owners and employers to better understand their states' reopening procedures during the coronavirus pandemic. The Chamber released an interactive map on Wednesday detailing which states have started the process of reopening their economy and what rules non-essential businesses must follow in those states. … For each state, the Chamber includes information on general workplace guidance for businesses that are reopening, such as social distancing guidance, personal protective equipment requirements and accommodations that should be provided to vulnerable populations during the health crisis. Most states require 6feet of separation between customers, but some have additional requirements such as occupancy limits, which range from a 25% limit to a 50% limit to no limit, according to the Chamber's press release.”Pressure on president's son-in-law - NYT: “This spring, as the United States faced a critical shortage of masks, gloves and other protective equipment to battle the coronavirus pandemic, a South Carolina physician reached out to the Federal Emergency Management Agency with an offer of help. Dr. Jeffrey Hendricks had longtime manufacturing contacts in China and a line on millions of masks from established suppliers. Instead of encountering seasoned FEMA procurement officials, his information was diverted to a team of roughly a dozen young volunteers, recruited by the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and overseen by a former assistant to Mr. Kushner’s wife, Ivanka Trump. The volunteers, foot soldiers in the Trump administration’s new supply-chain task force, had little to no experience with government procurement procedures or medical equipment. But as part of Mr. Kushner’s governmentwide push to secure protective gear for the nation’s doctors and nurses, the volunteers were put in charge of sifting through more than a thousand incoming leads, and told to pass only the best ones on for further review by FEMA officials.”THE RULEBOOK: IF HE DOES SAY SO HIMSELF “I venture somewhat further, and hesitate not to affirm, that if the manner of [electing the president] be not perfect, it is at least excellent.

The Channel Tunnel, or ‘Chunnel,’ connects Folkestone, England, with Coquelles, France, 31 miles away. The Chunnel cut travel time between England and France to a swift 35 minutes and eventually between London and Paris to two-and-a-half hours. As the world’s longest undersea tunnel, the Chunnel runs under water for 23 miles, with an average depth of 150 feet below the seabed. Each day, about 30,000 people, 6,000 cars and 3,500 trucks journey through the Chunnel on passenger, shuttle and freight trains. … In 1996, the American Society of Civil Engineers identified the tunnel as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCEAverage approval: 44.6 percentAverage disapproval: 49.8 percentNet Score: -5.2 pointsChange from one week ago: ↑ 0.6 points[Average includes: Monmouth University: 44% approve - 51% disapprove; PRRI: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; IBD: 44% approve - 44% disapprove; Gallup: 49% approve - 47% disapprove; USA Today/Suffolk University: 43% approve - 53% disapprove.]  WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

The Monmouth University Poll finds that voters are divided on the credibility of a sexual assault allegation against the Democratic nominee. The poll also finds that former President Barack Obama is largely popular with the American electorate, 2020 voters are not as interested in considering a third party candidate as they were four years ago, and Democrats hold a lead in the generic House ballot. Also, half the nation’s voters are likely to consider voting by mail this November. Biden currently has the support of 50% of registered voters and Trump has the support of 41%. Another 3% say they would vote for an independent candidate and 5% are undecided. This represents a slightly wider lead for the Democrat than in previous Monmouth polls – 48% to 44% in April and 48% to 45% in March.”Biden faces continued pressure on veep pick - WaPo: “Joe Biden is under escalating pressure from competing branches of his party as he ponders the most consequential decision of his presidential candidacy: a running mate. Black Democrats have joined in a concerted effort to urge him to pick a black woman as his vice-presidential nominee. Now some liberal groups and activists, who have long had an antagonistic relationship with the presumptive nominee, are pressing Biden to select a liberal woman. … Biden’s decision could foretell which direction he believes is most important for the party he now leads and which parts of the party he thinks must be mobilized to win the White House. Democrats have been split since 2016 over whether energizing black voters or winning over some white working-class voters in the industrial Midwest represents the best shot for the party in November. Hillary Clinton’s defeat four years ago was narrow enough that either option could explain it, giving Democrats little certainty as they try to wrestle the presidency from Trump.”Trump stays quiet while campaign runs with Biden assault claim - Politico: “The Trump campaign is going all in on Tara Reade’s sexual assault allegations against Joe Biden. Donald Trump? Not so much. It’s a disconnect that stems from the different calculations each is making. The campaign sees a political opening. … But on this one issue, Trump appears to see himself in Biden. He has talked about the allegation as akin to the more than 20 women who have — he claims — baselessly accused him of sexual misconduct. … Trump’s rare hesitation to go on the attack against a political opponent has not stopped campaign operatives from plotting a full-tilt offensive around the allegations. They have released an attack video, taken to social media, written op-eds and sent talking points to surrogates. They say the political benefits outweigh the drawback of reminding voters of the scores of women who have relayed various stories about Trump’s own alleged sexual misconduct.”Trump faces tough sell with black voters - NPR: “Before the coronavirus crisis decimated the U.S. economy, the record-low unemployment rate for African Americans was the backbone of President Trump's reelection pitch to black voters. It was always a tough sell, given his past performance with African Americans. Now it's even tougher after the pandemic has erased economic gains and forced the campaign to adjust its message in its outreach to black voters. Early government data show that black employees are losing work at a higher rate than white workers. … Trump has directed his White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council to focus on minority communities affected by the coronavirus. The council, headed by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, is supposed to identify additional funding needs for these areas.”Judge orders N.Y. primary to proceed - WSJ: “New York’s presidential primary will proceed as planned on June 23, a federal judge ordered Tuesday. U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres said in a 30-page ruling that officials at the New York State Board of Elections violated the constitutional rights of former presidential candidate Andrew Yang as well as delegates for him and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders when they canceled the state’s Democratic presidential primary last week.”STALEMATE ON STIMULUSWaPo: “President Trump’s latest red line for the next phase of coronavirus legislation — a payroll tax cut for workers — has few fans in Congress even among Republicans, further complicating the path toward a new rescue package as House Democrats rush to release their own plan as early as next week. As senators returned to Washington this week to an unusually sparse and eerie Capitol, resistance began to mount against Trump’s favored form of putting more money into workers’ pockets, with lawmakers noting that a payroll tax cut helps only those gainfully employed at a time when record numbers of Americans are filing jobless claims. The payroll tax funds the Social Security and Medicare programs. The intraparty rift on a payroll tax cut comes as the Democratic-led House scrambles to produce additional coronavirus legislation with perhaps another massive price tag. Senate Republicans, meanwhile, made it clear they will hit pause on any rescue package as they begin to scrutinize the effectiveness of previous rounds of aid sent to states, hospitals, consumers and small businesses.”Coronavirus creates eerie scene on Capitol Hill - Fox News: “Coronavirus certainly didn’t upend the political sniping. That’s never seemed to subside on Capitol Hill. But, the two Senate hearings shed light on what life on Capitol Hill likely will be like for months – if not much longer. When the House met briefly Tuesday morning to swear-in Rep. Kweisi Mfume, D-Md., a handful of members stood at a distance. House Reading Clerk Susan Cole and House Chaplain Rev. Patrick Conroy spoke not from the dais, but from a lectern far away in the House chamber. … The Capitol has pulsed whenever Congress was in session. There’d be a clamor in the halls. Bells and buzzers would sound, signaling votes on the floor. Elevators rattled. A din filtered out into the hallways of the Longworth House Office Building as lobbyists and tourists co-mingled, waiting in line for coffee. Long lines snaked around corridors in the Hart Senate Office Building for major hearings. But, not now. Congress won’t have any of that anytime soon, and it’s unclear when it can.”McConnell protégé, Trump’s judicial nominee clashes with Dems - WaPo: “President Trump’s nominee to the most influential federal appeals court clashed with Democrats over his past comments about the Affordable Care Act, while Republicans praised his recent ruling allowing limited Easter church services during the coronavirus pandemic. Judge Justin Walker, a protege of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, faced criticism at Wednesday’s confirmation hearing over his remarks two years ago that rulings upholding the ACA were ‘indefensible’ and about jokes he made at the law’s expense at a ceremony in March marking his entry onto the federal bench. Republicans are pushing to elevate Walker to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit — a promotion that Democrats decry as too quick for the 37-year-old after just six months as a district judge in Kentucky.”CALIFORNIA HOUSE RACE A SNAPSHOT OF THINGS TO COMENYT: “Christy Smith, a Democratic House candidate in suburban Los Angeles, had just finished a debate (over Zoom, of course) and was eager to point something out: First, President Trump had endorsed her Republican opponent, Mike Garcia. Then the president raised the specter of voting fraud, writing on Twitter: ‘Turn your Ballots in now and track them, watching for dishonesty. Report to Law Enforcement.’ Democrats saw this special election on May 12 as a referendum on Mr. Trump even before the coronavirus crisis brought his leadership front and center for many Americans. For Mr. Garcia, the president’s support means potentially more donors and a motivated, loyal base. For Ms. Smith, it’s a vulnerability to attack. … The election is a microcosm of the country’s politics amid the health crisis: It is an early test of Mr. Trump’s sway in a race both he and his former rival, Hillary Clinton, have weighed in on. It is a battle over vote-by-mail in which doubts have been sown over the election’s integrity. And it is showing just how nasty politics can be, even under lockdown.”Candidates turned relief workers - Politico: “Clayton Fuller was filming his first campaign ad for Congress when he got a call from his Air National Guard commanding officer: He was being activated for coronavirus duty. Now the Republican from Georgia is spending his days far away from the campaign trail, coordinating the cleaning of nursing and veterans’ homes in Alabama. But because he’s under federal orders, he can no longer ask for votes himself — this week, he’s missing two virtual candidate forums. … Fuller represents an extreme example of how the coronavirus has transformed elections up and down the ballot. With electioneering largely on hold, campaigns are adapting in fundamental ways — many morphing into mini-relief organizations by channeling their donor and volunteer bases into coronavirus-related work in their communities. The pivot is part altruism and part political self-interest: The candidates are raising big money for relief, but in many cases are making sure voters know about their good deeds, now and in the run-up to November. Campaigning under coronavirus runs the gamut.”Loeffler leans in to wealth - Politico: “Republican Kelly Loeffler is leaning on one of her greatest assets and most glaring liabilities to turn around her campaign: her money. The Georgia senator, facing declining poll numbers and ongoing scrutiny over controversial stock trades, this week launched a $4 million ad campaign highlighting ways she’s used her wealth for Covid aid efforts in her state. Those include donating her salary, deploying her private plane to help transport stranded cruise ship passengers and making a $1 million personal donation to a relief organization, along with her support of the Senate's legislative responses.”New Mexico House primary garbage fire intensifies - AP: “A candidate in a contentious Republican U.S. House primary in southern New Mexico is calling for one of her opponents to withdraw amid an increasingly personal and nasty contest. Oil executive Claire Chase demanded Monday that former state lawmaker Yvette Herrell exit the race over accusations Herrell was pushing false rumors around Chase’s first marriage — charges Herrell vigorously denies. … ‘Yvette’s candidacy is no longer viable and she should drop out of this race for the good of the Republican Party.’ In an interview with The Associated Press, retired U.S. Marine Jared Richardson said Herrell called last month after he announced his support for Chase on social media and told him that Chase cheated on her first husband while he was deployed in Afghanistan. But according to Chase, she met her current husband after her divorce and two years following her former husband’s return from deployment.”Nevada Dems drop lawsuit against all-mail primary election - The Nevada Independent: “A cadre of Democratic Party-aligned groups is temporarily dropping a lawsuit asking a state court to implement multiple changes to the planned all-mail primary election in June after Clark County election officials agreed to expand in-person voting sites and other changes. The plaintiffs — including Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, progressive political nonprofit Priorities USA — announced their decision to drop the lawsuit in a joint press release sent out Tuesday after Clark County election officials said in a court filing that they would add two additional in-person voting sites and send out ballots to ‘inactive’ voters.”PLAY-BY-PLAYJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg hospitalized with infection, doing fine and still working - Fox NewsPergram: As coronavirus sparks changes, DC blame game intensifies - Fox NewsAUDIBLE: YOU KNOW YOU DID, YOU KNOW YOU DID…“But if this ever changin' world in which we live in makes you give in and cry….” – Lyrics from the Guns n’ Roses cover of Paul McCartney’s “Live and Let Die” which was awkwardly blaring overhead as President Trump toured a factory in Arizona on a campaign stop.FROM THE BLEACHERS","1598827121","1");

Sign up here.**PRESENTING YOUR PRESIDENTIAL POWER RANKINGSIn times of testing the rhythms of normal life can be a comfort, so let then the return of the Halftime Report Power Rankings be a comfort to you.We’re going to start our rankings for this election cycle with, what else, the Electoral College. We hope what you find below to be self-explanatory, but first a few notes for users.We have sorted the 50 states and the District of Columbia into five categories: Those states Democrat Joe Biden is likely to win, those states in which Biden has an advantage but the race is competitive, or there is a “lean,” those states that are pure toss ups, those states that are leaning toward President Trump but remain competitive and those states that are likely to vote for the incumbent.As you will see, there are more than enough electoral votes in the toss up category to put both sides within reach of victory. But you will also see that Democrats are starting with an advantage. Taken together “likely” and “lean” Democratic states account for 249 electoral votes, just 21 shy of the needed 270.Republicans open the bidding with 186 electoral votes on their side of the ledger, but that is typical of a party that tends to fare poorly in densely populated areas. Democrats can rely on behemoths like New York and California while Texas is the only reliably red state among those with 20 or more electoral votes. Every presidential election is a test of whether Republicans can bring enough medium sized swing states together to get the job done.We have ranked the states in the “toss up” category based on their competitiveness, that is to say in order of which states we think are the closest. The “lean” states are only listed by their number of electoral votes and the “likely” states are just by alphabetical order. You will find the most competitive states at the top of the note and the others below the fold.You will probably disagree with our judgement. That’s good! We rely on our readers to not only keep us honest in our assessments, but also to tell us what they are seeing and hearing in their own necks of the woods. Write to us and tell us what you think. Please remember that it’s early, very little polling has been done so far and the political consequences of an unprecedented shutdown make for a very volatile environment. We expect these rankings to change and change often.That’s all part of the fun.TOSS UPS(103 electoral votes)WISCONSIN10 electoral votes2016 results: Trump 47.2 percent, Clinton 46.5, others 6.3 percentPerhaps no state has been so narrowly divided for so long as Wisconsin. Big wins by Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 convinced Democrats that the Badger State was safe territory, but Obama’s winning coalition departed with him, putting the state back on a knife’s edge. George W. Bush missed here by less than half of a point in both of his runs and even a casual observer of state politics know that it’s ugly business. The recent brawl over holding an in-person primary election during the coronavirus lockdown was proof enough of that. Wisconsin looks to us like Trump’s best bet to hold on to one of the three “blue wall” states he flipped in 2016. It’s substantially whiter than Pennsylvania and Michigan and the Republican machine in the state is well oiled. Biden, though, sees plenty of promise. Clinton missed Obama’s 2012 number by nearly a quarter million votes – 10 times Trump’s margin of victory.OHIO18 electoral votes2016 result: Trump 51.3%, Clinton 43.2%, others 5.5%For the first time in more than two decades, the Buckeye State was not at the heart of the presidential battleground map in 2016. Donald Trump opened up a lead coming out of his nomination at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and never looked back. Trump went on to rack up an 8-point victory, the largest victory margin by a presidential candidate in Ohio since George H.W. Bush in 1988. But now, like Bush, Trump is facing a potential reversal in Ohio as an incumbent. Democrats on the state and federal level have shown strongly in the past four years, particularly pro-union Sen. Sherrod Brown. The key battleground between Trump and Joe Biden will be the state’s northern tier, home to eight of the nine counties that went from red to blue from 2012 to 2016. Voters who live around Toledo and Cleveland, your break is over. It’s back to being at the center of the storm.FLORIDA29 electoral votes2016 result: Trump 48.6%, Clinton 47.4%, others 4%With a massive cache of 29 electoral votes and a long history of excruciatingly close elections, including the hanging chads of 2000, the Sunshine State is the king of the swing states. Since George W. Bush’s 537-vote victory 20 years ago, the state has split evenly for Republican and Democratic presidential candidates. The past two elections were both decided by less than 2 points. In 2016, it looked for a time like Donald Trump might be on his way to a big (by Florida standards) win, but the race closed at the end and finished as a nail-biter. Since then, Republicans have prospered in Florida, with statewide wins for Senate and Governor despite headwinds in 2018. But 2020 promises a return of the old Florida model in which the Democratic strongholds of the south match up with Republican districts to the north with the prime battle zone along the I-4 corridor through Tampa and Orlando.ARIZONA11 electoral votes2016 result: Trump 48.1%, Clinton 44.6%, others 7.3%Arizona has about as much experience with swing-state politics as it does with blizzards, but it’s time to start shoveling. In the past 70 years, just one Democrat has carried the Grand Canyon State: Bill Clinton nipped Bob Dole in Clinton’s 1996 re-elect. Otherwise, Barry Goldwater’s home state has been a bastion for not just Republicans, but conservatism. Trump’s comparatively weak performance in 2016 is owed to several factors, including the decision by many traditional conservatives to vote for a third party or sit out the race in protest of Trump’s candidacy. But the main driver of political change in the state has been the influx of Americans from other states into Arizona. With a growing economy and an attractive climate for retirees, the state’s population has increased by 50 percent since the turn of the century. Over the same period, the state’s Hispanic population increased from 25 percent to 31 percent.PENNSYLVANIA20 electoral votes2016 election result: Trump 48.2%, Clinton 47.5%, other 4.3%There are a lot of ways to explain how Democrats settled on Biden for their nominee, but none of them is as clear as Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes. A native of Scranton in the state’s industrial east, Biden typifies the traditional Democratic politics of the state: moderation, blue-collar appeal and a folksy style. Hillary Clinton’s loss in big, blue Pennsylvania was a low point for the modern Democratic Party, one they believe Biden will reverse. But Trump is not without advantages. Those same voters who had supported Democrats like Biden in the past show a strong affinity for the incumbent. The reality may be that Democrats have lost places like Wilkes-Barre and Scranton and will have to make up the difference elsewhere. Key battlegrounds will be in the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh suburbs where Republicans must stop their ongoing losses and in urban centers where Democrats must energize African-American voters who were cool on Clinton.NORTH CAROLINA15 electoral votes2016 election result: Trump 49.8%, Clinton 46.2%, other 4%The Tar Heel state was part of the Solid South for Republicans for 40 years until Barack Obama’s narrow win in 2008. Republicans brought the state back with small margins in the next two contests, but North Carolina is back in play in a big way. With a Democratic governor, a competitive race for freshman Sen. Thom Tillis’ seat and rough parity in voter registrations, Carolina Blue looks very possible. Like Obama before him, Trump is going to be re-nominated in Charlotte, but hopes to avoid Obama’s fate in November here. Charlotte matters bigly. Its county, Mecklenburg, was a rare bright spot for Hillary Clinton, who outperformed Obama in the Queen City’s suburbs. If Biden can expand her edge with the state’s large number of affluent voters and reverse some of her slide with black turnout, this will get to be a close race very quickly.THE RULEBOOK: AIN’T THAT THE TRUTH“Man is very much a creature of habit. A thing that rarely strikes his senses will generally have but little influence upon his mind.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 27TIME OUT: CHEERS, MARJORIE BBC: “Standing in the packed streets of Versailles, France, 75 years ago, Marjorie Morgan celebrated VE Day. Just hours before, she had driven an Allied general to Reims, and stood outside as a German general signed the unconditional surrender to end World War Two in Europe. ‘To me it was just a job, it was something you think about afterwards,’ she said. While the 98-year-old believes there was nothing remarkable about her role during the war, hers is one of the many incredible stories of sacrifice made by people from communities across Wales all those years ago. Today, like others who remember that time, Marjorie will celebrate the anniversary of VE Day on a much smaller scale… Marjorie, like thousands of women, joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS), the women's branch of the British Army during the war effort. After spending years as an army driving instructor, by 1945 she was driving generals, and ended up driving to the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) in Reims, where General Alfred Jodl, German Chief of Operations, signed the unconditional surrender.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD Average approval: 45.2 percentAverage disapproval: 50 percentNet Score: -4.8 pointsChange from one week ago: no change in points[Average includes: CNBC: 46% approve - 54% disapprove; Monmouth University: 44% approve - 51% disapprove; PRRI: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; IBD: 44% approve - 44% disapprove; Gallup: 49% approve - 47% disapprove.]  WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

Ever since Republicans took hold of America’s second-most populous state 40 years ago, Democrats have tried to take it back. That fixation helps explain why they are so keen on competing in a stat where they took a 9-point thumping four years ago. What Democrats see when they look at Texas is a place where Republicans are on the decline with the state’s abundant population of well-to-do suburban white voters and that the numbers of young, less-conservative voters is growing. As was evidenced in their pyrite expedition for former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, Texas Democrats can be competitive under the right circumstances. But look at the top of the ballot in 2018. While unpopular Sen. Ted Cruz struggled to keep his seat, Gov. Greg Abbot stormed to victory in a year where Republicans were in big trouble. Texas may end up as a close race, but it will mean a blue stampede in 2020.GEORGIA16 electoral votes2016 results: Trump 50.4%, Clinton 45.4%, others 4.2%Everything that makes Democrats optimistic about Georgia is true. The state’s population is young and increasingly ethnically diverse. Long-held Republican districts in the Atlanta suburbs are increasingly hard for the GOP to maintain as college-educated voters shun the party. All true. And yet… We go through the Democratic mania for Georgia every two years, and sometimes it gets pretty close to the real thing. In 2018, Democrats came within a little more than a point of winning back the governor’s mansion. And certainly the state’s Republicans are a mess, as illustrated by the ugly primary of that year and the one for Senate this cycle. Democrats’ struggle in Georgia remains an unwieldy coalition between moderate suburban whites who were long the driving force in the party’s politics and more extreme voices on the left, like 2018 gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams. Biden should be able to outperform Hillary Clinton if he can win support from both groups, but it won’t be easy.IOWA6 electoral votes2016 election result: Trump 51.2%, Clinton 41.7%, other 7.1%Trump’s 2016 Iowa victory was truly impressive. A double-digit spread in a state that had sided with Democrats in six of the seven previous elections may be better evidence of how Trump reshaped politics than anything else. Trump’s 5-point improvement over Mitt Romney’s 2012 showing in Iowa was the largest of any of the five states that went from blue to red four years ago. It can be said of some other states that Democrats lost, but it’s right to say in Iowa that Republicans won. Iowa’s population is 90 percent white and the state is home to large numbers of Evangelical Christians, key demographics for Trump. Democrats’ hopes rely on re-engaging the large numbers of union workers in the eastern part of the state, picking off the state’s few suburban precincts and hoping that farmers’ resentment over Trump’s trade wars will cool their ardor for the incumbent.LEAN DEMOCRATIC (36 electoral votes)MICHIGAN16 electoral votes2016 election result: Trump 47.3%, Clinton 47%, other 5.7%In his 2012 re-elect, Barack Obama won Michigan by more than 9 points. That makes Trump’s breathtakingly narrow win the largest shift from red to blue of any state he flipped four years ago other than Iowa. But what Trump may see as his pinnacle, Democrats see as their nadir. In no state was Hillary Clinton’s underperformance more painfully obvious. She missed her marks not just with African-American voters in Detroit but with blue-collar, union-friendly white voters beyond the city. But since 2016, Democrats have come back strong in Michigan, sweeping every statewide office and winning back two House seats. And certainly Biden will not make Clinton’s mistake of ignoring the Great Lakes State. Polls show a consistent advantage for Biden, but then again they had similar findings at this point in 2016.NEVADA6 electoral votes2016 result: Clinton 47.9%, Trump 45.5%, others 6.6%Nevada’s political story in the past 20 years has been similar to that of much of the West: booming population growth has made the once Republican-leaning state much more Democratic. Democrats now hold the governorship, both Senate seats and three of four House seats.  In 2016, Trump did slightly worse in his share of the vote than Mitt Romney four years prior but still managed to come much closer than his predecessor’s 5-point loss. In no state was Hillary Clinton’s underperformance compared to Barack Obama more obvious than in the Silver State, where she missed his 2012 mark by more than 4 points. Clinton bled support to minor candidates and sloe Nevada’s unique “none of the above” option. Democrats feel confident that the better liked Biden will thrive in Nevada, especially given the state’s strong organized labor movement.MINNESOTA10 electoral votes2016 result: Clinton 46.4%, Trump 44.9%, others 8.7%Oh how Republicans have yearned to brink Minnesota into the fold of other Midwestern, red-tinted states despite 48 years of defeats. And their loss in 2016 by less than 2 points – the closest since Walter Mondale’s paper-thin home state win in 1984 – has made it even more tantalizing for them. The cause for Republican hope in the North Star State is in part due to Hillary Clinton’s abysmal 6-point drop compared to Barack Obama in 2012, but also demographics. With a population that is 84 percent white, Minnesota seems like it should be favorable to Republicans. But compared to its neighbors, Minnesota is actually quite diverse. The state has also seen brisk population growth and maintained a comparatively low median age while states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio have struggled. Team Trump is betting that they can drive Biden’s numbers low enough to bring the state back into play, but Biden is starting with a good hand.NEW HAMPSHIRE4 electoral votes2016 election result: Clinton 46.8%, Trump 46.5%, others 6.7%New Hampshire is an independent state in every sense. It’s New England’s only swing state and prizes it’s political unpredictability, whether it's a primary contest or a general election. On the presidential level, the state has certainly had a Democratic tilt. No Republican has won the Granite State since George W. Bush in 2000. Hillary Clinton came close in 2016, though. Her third-of-a-point margin of  victory was the smallest for a Democrat in the state since Woodrow Wilson in 1916. Trump’s success for years ago with the blue-collar white voters of the economically struggling northern and western parts of the states as well as among residents in the southern tier who fled Massachusetts’ high taxes makes New Hampshire the top prospect for a blue-to-red flip this cycle. Democrats, meanwhile, hope Biden’s appeal to middle-class white voters will take the state out of play. LIKELY REPUBLICAN (126 electoral votes)Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming.LIKELY DEMOCRATIC (213 electoral votes)California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Washington, D.C., Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.AUDIBLE: MIC CHECK“Today at our news briefing, there was an audio glitch.

The Queen guitarist and astrophysicist broke the news with an Instagram selfie from the hospital wearing a face mask with a nurse standing behind him—writing that he ripped his ‘Gluteus Maximus to shreds in a moment of over-enthusiastic gardening.’ … ‘Yes, I’ve been quiet. Reason?,’ explaining his absence on social media, ‘As well as getting over-stretched and harassed by too many demands … I managed to rip my Gluteus Maximus to shreds in a moment of over-enthusiastic gardening,’ said the 72-year-old rocker.

Trump appeared to be set off by an announcement the day before from Michigan's Democratic secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, who said her office will mail an absentee ballot application to every voter in the state for August and November elections. Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016, giving him the Electoral College votes needed to become president. Trump is expected to visit the state on Thursday to tour a Ford facility that has been repurposed to make ventilators. In a tweet Wednesday, Trump falsely claimed the state was sending ballots, not ballot applications, and said its federal funding was at risk. The president wrote: ‘I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!’”Craves bigger venues - Politico: “The Trump campaign has an order from the president: Find a way to get him back on the road and into megarallies to re-energize his base.

The president visited two medical supply facilities in Arizona and Pennsylvania this month and will tour a Ford ventilator factory in Michigan on Thursday. The official White House travel replaced what would have otherwise been a much busier campaign season for the president, who held three rallies in three days at the end of February. Before the end of this month, the Trump campaign hopes to organize a series of virtual events featuring the president, who has eschewed the digital campaign trail while others involved with his reelection court voters and train supporters during nightly live streams and online briefings.”Biden denounces left-wing anti-Semitism - NYT: “Former Vice President Joseph R.

The plan was discussed in a May 11 conference call with a senior staffer for the Trump reelection campaign organized by CNP Action, an affiliate of the GOP-aligned Council for National Policy. A leaked recording of the hourlong call was provided to The Associated Press by the Center for Media and Democracy, a progressive watchdog group.

Kendall, a 30-something executive of the Pepsi-Cola Company, poured a fateful cup of cold Pepsi. The recipient, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, had just been engaged in the infamous ‘Kitchen Debate’ with the visiting U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon. Hoping this pour would prove worthwhile, Kendall’s business acumen would cement the Soviet Union’s love for the beverage… At the Moscow event, Americans showcased cars, dishwashers, televisions, and, at Kendall’s booth, Pepsi soda. Kendall, a friend of Nixon’s, told The New York Times, ‘I went to Nixon the night before, at the embassy, and told him I was in a lot of trouble at home because people thought I was wasting Pepsi’s money coming to a Communist country.’ Kendall knew he ‘had to get a Pepsi in Khrushchev’s hand.’ Nixon made it happen. The ensuing photo of Khrushchev holding a cup of Pepsi was a publicist’s dream.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD PRESIDENTIAL POWER RANKINGS(270 electoral votes needed to win)Toss-up: (103 electoral votes): Wisconsin (10), Ohio (18), Florida (29), Arizona (11), Pennsylvania (20), North Carolina (15)Lean R/Likely R: (186 electoral votes) Lean D/Likely D: (249 electoral votes)[Full rankings here.]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCEAverage approval: 45.4 percentAverage disapproval: 51.4 percentNet Score: -6 pointsChange from one week ago: ↑ 0.2 points  [Average includes: Quinnipiac University: 42% approve - 53% disapprove; Gallup: 49% approve - 48% disapprove; CNN: 46% approve - 51% disapprove; CNBC: 46% approve - 54% disapprove; Monmouth University: 44% approve - 51% disapprove.] WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

Mr. Pompeo chose instead to answer written questions from investigators working for the inspector general, Steve A. Linick, who was fired by President Trump on Friday. That indicates that the secretary of state was aware of Mr. Linick’s investigation and the specific lines of questioning about Mr. Pompeo’s decision last year to resume the sales of bombs and other weapons, which had been stalled since 2017. Saudi Arabia has led Persian Gulf nations in an air war in Yemen that has resulted in large numbers of civilian deaths.”Services of longtime aide also under investigation - Kansas City Star: “Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s treatment of a longtime aide from Kansas who worked for him at the Central Intelligence Agency and then the State Department was under scrutiny by an inspector general recently fired by President Donald Trump, government sources familiar with the matter [said]. The State Department inspector general, Steve Linick, was looking into the role of Toni Porter, Pompeo’s senior adviser, and whether she as a political appointee was conducting Pompeo’s personal business on government time, two sources said. Porter did not register a complaint herself to the inspector general. Rather, the investigation into her role was triggered by multiple complaints on the IG hotline, one of the sources said.”Pompeo denies wrongdoing, sorry he didn’t fire I.G. sooner - NYT: “Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday defended his recommendation to fire the State Department’s inspector general, saying he should have done it sooner. Tersely responding to questions from reporters at a State Department briefing, Mr. Pompeo called it ‘patently false’ that he asked President Trump to dismiss the inspector general, Steve A. Linick, as retaliation for the opening of inquiries into his potential misuse of government resources. Mr. Pompeo said he had been unaware of those investigations when he made his recommendation to the president. He refused to give his reasons for wanting Mr. Linick removed, citing personnel privacy issues. But of his request that Mr. Linick be dismissed, Mr. Pompeo said he ‘frankly should have done it some time ago.’”OREGON REPUBLICANS PICK WALDEN REPLACEMENTRoll Call: “Republican primary voters in Oregon chose a former soldier who starred as himself in a Clint Eastwood movie … Former state Sen. Cliff Bentz won the GOP primary in Oregon’s 2nd District on Tuesday in the race to replace Rep. Greg Walden, the only Republican in the Beaver State’s congressional delegation, who is retiring after 11 terms.

Bentz will be the heavy favorite in the deep-red, rural district that backed President Donald Trump by 20 points in 2016.”FEDS WARN CALIFORNIA ON LOCKDOWN RULESLAT: “The U.S. Justice Department issued a letter Tuesday warning that California could be violating religious freedoms in its plan to reopen the state after the coronavirus stay-at-home order. The letter from the Justice Department’s civil rights division to Gov. Gavin Newsom listed several objections both to the original order and the plan to slowly reopen the economy. The Justice Department questioned why religious work was not considered ‘essential’ while other sectors, including the entertainment and e-commerce industries, were allowed to continue operating. Federal officials also criticized the reopening plan for allowing restaurants, shopping malls, offices and manufacturing facilities to open under the state’s Phase 2 while religious institutions could not reopen for in-person services until Phase 3, which would occur later.”Anatomy of a conspiracy theory - NYT: “There have been plenty of jaw-dropping digital moments during the coronavirus pandemic. … Yet none of those went as viral as a 26-minute video called ‘Plandemic,’ a slickly produced narration that wrongly claimed a shadowy cabal of elites was using the virus and a potential vaccine to profit and gain power. The video featured a discredited scientist, Judy Mikovits, who said her research about the harm from vaccines had been buried. ‘Plandemic’ went online on May 4 when its maker, Mikki Willis, a little-known film producer, posted it to Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and a separate website set up to share the video. For three days, it gathered steam in Facebook pages dedicated to conspiracy theories and the anti-vaccine movement, most of which linked to the video hosted on YouTube.

The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee appeared on the Breakfast Club, a radio program that is widely regarded in the black community. The host, Charlamagne Tha God, pressed Biden on reports that he is considering Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is white, to be vice president… [Biden] then added: ‘If you’ve got a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or for Trump, then you ain’t black.’ … Symone Sanders, a Biden senior adviser who is also black, said his comment in Friday’s interview was ‘made in jest.’ ‘Let’s be clear about what the VP was saying,’ Sanders tweeted. ‘He was making the distinction that he would put his record with the African American community up against Trump’s any day. Period.’”Radio host says he wants results, not talk from Biden - Mediaite: “Charlamagne replied, ‘It don’t have nothing to do with Trump. It has to do with the fact that I want something for my community.’ Biden said his record in that area was ‘second to none.’ In a statement to Mediaite, Charlamagne said his response stood on its own. ‘We have been loyal to Democrats for a long time, black people have invested a lot into that party and the return on investment has not been great,’ he wrote. ‘As Biden said in our brief interview when I asked him if Dems owe the black community ABSOLUTELY was his answer. So let’s see what you got!!! Votes are Quid Pro Quo. You can’t possibly want me to Fear Trump MORE than I want something for my people.’”Trump campaign calls Biden’s line ‘dehumanizing’ - Bloomberg: “‘It is clear now more than ever, following these racist and dehumanizing remarks, that Joe Biden believes black men and women are incapable of being independent or free thinking,’ Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign senior adviser, said in a statement issued by ‘Black Voices for Trump.’ ‘Frankly I would love to have a policy contrast with Joe Biden and President Trump on the things that we’ve been able to accomplish,’ [South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott] said in a conference call he and Pierson held with reporters. On Thursday, during a visit to a Ford plant that makes ventilators, Trump praised Henry Ford, who was openly racist and anti-Semitic. Trump said Ford has ‘good bloodlines, good bloodlines, if you believe in that stuff.’”Bernie backers not opening wallets for Biden - WSJ: Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has yet to unlock a key part of the party’s fundraising base less than six months before Election Day: Bernie Sanders’s army of online small donors, a Wall Street Journal analysis found. About 60,000 people who gave to the Vermont senator during the Democratic primary had also chipped in to Mr. Biden’s campaign by the end of April, according to the Journal’s analysis of Federal Election Commission data filed this week. That group amounted to just under 3% of the roughly 2.2 million total Sanders donors the Journal identified in public filings.”Reade’s work as expert witness called into doubt - NYT: “Defense lawyers in California are reviewing criminal cases in which Tara Reade, the former Senate aide who has accused Joseph R. Biden Jr. of sexual assault, served as an expert witness on domestic violence, concerned that she misrepresented her educational credentials in court. Then known as Alexandra McCabe, Ms. Reade testified as a government witness in Monterey County courts for nearly a decade, describing herself as an expert in the dynamics of domestic violence who had counseled hundreds of victims. But lawyers who had faced off against her in court began raising questions about the legitimacy of her testimony, and the verdicts that followed, after news reports this week that Antioch University had disputed her claim of receiving a bachelor’s degree from its Seattle campus.”Lawyer drops - NY Post: “Joe Biden sex assault accuser Tara Reade and her lawyer have parted ways. Attorney Douglas Wigdor announced the split Friday just weeks after Reade, a former Senate staffer of Biden’s, hired the high-profile sex-harassment lawyer. In a statement, the Manhattan litigator did not provide a reason for the decision but said it had nothing to do with the veracity of Reade’s claims that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Biden assaulted her in the 1990s. ‘Our firm no longer represents Tara Reade. Our decision, made on May 20, is by no means a reflection on whether then-Senator Biden sexually assaulted Ms. Reade,’ Wigdor wrote before defending his former client’s poor treatment in the media.”THE RULEBOOK: MORE MONEY, MORE PROBLEMS“The importance of commerce, in the view of revenue alone, must effectually guard it against the enmity of a body which would be continually importuned in its favor, by the urgent calls of public necessity.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 60TIME OUT: IN MEMORIUMIf the United States of America was the beneficiary of the most advantaged birth of any nation in history, our passage into adulthood more than made up for it in terms of suffering.Monday is Memorial Day, an opportunity to decorate the graves and remember all those who laid down their lives in defense of this nation, “the last best hope of earth.” It is our duty and privilege as the beneficiaries of their sacrifices.But the observance began with the memory of the Civil War dead, first among the widows of Confederate soldiers and then taken up by the survivors of the Union side. Initially known as Decoration Day, the holiday came into its current form in 1971.The first 85 years of our national history was a breathless sprint forward. Our meager forces twice defeated the most powerful empire in the world with minimal casualties, the size of the new nation had more than tripled and our wealth was multiplying even faster. The race was on.But the unfinished work of our founding – the elimination of slavery – would stop that sprint. What Americans North and South could not know in 1861 was just how painful completing that task would be.The scope of the slaughter and magnitude of the loss defies even the understanding of the Americans who endured in the great wars of the 20th century. To try to grasp the scale, imagine if almost 8 million Americans today had been killed in a war.But numbers will not answer in a matter like this one. So, we turn to poetry.Herman Melville was deeply affected by the war, which had drawn in so many of his friends and relatives.  He, too old by then for service, visited the front himself and saw the carnage firsthand.The battle of Shiloh in April 1862 was the first battle to reveal the magnitude of the horrors to come. A Confederate ambush led to an eventual Union victory that claimed nearly 24,000 dead and wounded in less than two days. The terrible, ravening beast of modern warfare had been loosed on our land.The story of a frontier church where the casualties from both sides lay dying stirred Melville:Shiloh: A RequiemSkimming lightly, wheeling still,The swallows fly lowOver the field in clouded days,The forest-field of Shiloh—Over the field where April rainSolaced the parched ones stretched in painThrough the pause of nightThat followed the Sunday fightAround the church of Shiloh—The church so lone, the log-built one,That echoed to many a parting groanAnd natural prayerOf dying foemen mingled there—Foemen at morn, but friends at eve—Fame or country least their care:(What like a bullet can undeceive!)But now they lie low,While over them the swallows skim,And all is hushed at Shiloh.[Ed. note: Halftime Report will not be published on Monday in observance of Memorial Day.]Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD PRESIDENTIAL POWER RANKINGS(270 electoral votes needed to win)Toss-up: (103 electoral votes): Wisconsin (10), Ohio (18), Florida (29), Arizona (11), Pennsylvania (20), North Carolina (15)Lean R/Likely R: (186 electoral votes) Lean D/Likely D: (249 electoral votes)[Full rankings here.]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCEAverage approval: 44.2 percentAverage disapproval: 52.6 percentNet Score: -8.4 pointsChange from one week ago: ↑ 0.2 points  [Average includes: American Research Group: 40% approve - 57% disapprove; Fox News: 44% approve - 54% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 42% approve - 53% disapprove; CNN: 46% approve - 51% disapprove; Gallup: 49% approve - 48% disapprove.] WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

The latest Fox News Poll finds voters trust Biden to do a better job than Trump on health care by 17 points, coronavirus by 9, and relations with China by 6. Trump is trusted more on the economy by a slim 3-point margin. … Eighty-eight percent are concerned about coronavirus spreading and 78 percent feel the economy is in bad shape. There has been a seismic shift in views on the economy since the pandemic. In January, voters rated economic conditions positively by an 11-point margin… Today, views are negative by 58 points:  20 percent excellent/good vs. 78 percent only fair/poor. … In the 2020 ballot test, Biden leads Trump by 48-40 percent. … However, given that 11 percent are undecided or plan to vote for someone else, neither candidate hits 50 percent support. The race could go either way.”Trump on another possible outbreak: ‘We’re not closing our country’ - NY Post: “President Trump said the US will not shut down again if a second wave of coronavirus infections emerges. ‘We’re not going close the country,’ Trump told reporters Thursday while touring a Ford plant in Michigan. ‘We’re going to put out the fires. Whether it’s an ember or a flame, we’re going put it out, but we’re not closing our country.’ The commander-in-chief said there’s a ‘very distinct possibility’ that the deadly virus starts to spread again as states lift lockdown measures meant to control it. But he suggested that officials will address new outbreaks individually rather than impose widespread restrictions like those that have hammered the US economy in the past two months. ‘This is a country that’s meant to be open, not closed,’ Trump said. ‘I want it open, and we’re going to open, and if there’s a fire, an ember, a flame someplace, we put it out.’”Trump wears mask, but not in front of cameras - Fox News: “President Trump on Thursday brought a mask with him to tour of a Ford plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., but said he didn’t ‘want to give the press the pleasure of seeing’ him wear it while he was on camera. ‘I didn’t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,’ he said. ‘In the back area I did have a mask on. I had goggles and a mask right back there.’ While speaking without a face covering -- next to others wearing masks -- the president added that masks were not necessary in the front of the plant, where he was standing. ‘They’re not necessary here. Everybody’s been tested, in fact I was tested this morning so it’s not necessary,’ the president said. … When asked if it was true that it wasn’t required that the president wear a mask, Ford’s CEO, Jim Hackett, told reporters, ‘It’s up to him.’”Alberta: ‘Life at the Trump Tailgate’ - Politico: “For the masses gathered on the side of the road, the sight of a presidential motorcade—and the knowledge that Donald Trump himself has come to their backyard, to visit the local Ford plant and pay homage to the old ‘Arsenal of Democracy’—is sufficient to distract from the suffering of the day. Country music blares from the back of a parked pickup truck. Giddy customers fork over $5 bills and pull MAGA shirts over their outfits. One man hoists a Betsy Ross-era flag from his fishing pole, with a naked brunette doll—'Governor Half-Whit!’ he cries, echoing a presidential putdown—dangling from a noose. … With no sports to watch, politics are the only game in town—and this is Trump’s tailgate, an experience as unique as the times, the closest thing to one of the president’s signature rallies at a moment when large gatherings have been banned.”Florida shapes up as ground zero for GOP in 2024 - Politico: “Even as attention focuses on the rapidly intensifying 2020 campaign and the unprecedented complications presented by Covid-19’s double-barreled health crisis and economic catastrophe, there’s another race already in progress. A number of well-known players in the GOP—former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and Vice President Mike Pence, among them—are considered leading contenders to succeed Trump should he win a second term. But Florida, which also boasts Senator Marco Rubio (who many expect to try and avenge his 2016 failure) and Rep. Matt Gaetz, a nationally known congressman and huge Trump ally, already looks like a uniquely consequential proving ground for several of the most likely Republican aspirants to the Oval Office. And it is captivating political insiders who see the contours of a still distant contest emerging in dramatic ways.”GOP SOUNDS ALARM ON MCSALLYPolitico: “Senior political advisers to President Donald Trump warned Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Thursday that Republican Sen. Martha McSally is falling dangerously behind in the critical swing state of Arizona. Trump’s campaign team was meeting with the president at the White House to discuss the state of play in a handful of battleground states. Toward the end of the meeting, Trump pulled McConnell, who was at the White House to meet with him on another matter, into the Roosevelt Room. The discussion turned to Arizona, where recent polling has shown Trump and McSally trailing. Trump himself said he was concerned about McSally, according to three people familiar with the discussion. His political advisers told McConnell about recent survey numbers in Arizona and stressed she was losing to Democrat and former astronaut Mark Kelly.”Loeffler isn’t going anywhere - Politico: “Kelly Loeffler is behind in the polls and best known for her fortuitously timed stock trades. But the Georgia Republican insisted during a 25-minute interview that she’s not going anywhere. ‘Not only am I not dropping out, but I'm gonna win,’ Loeffler said Thursday. ‘And no one's going to intimidate me into thinking that that's the right course for our party, for our state, for our country. I'm working hard to help reelect the president. I'm working hard to win my seat and keep the Senate in Republican hands.’ Loeffler’s five months as a senator have not been easy. She’s facing attacks from the left and right for selling millions of dollars in stocks after receiving a private briefing on the coronavirus pandemic. What’s more, she’s fighting off a serious challenge from Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) — a strong ally of President Donald Trump — who is ahead in most recent public polling.”Philadelphia elections judge admits taking bribes to inflate vote counts - Fox News: “A former Democratic elections judge has pleaded guilty for his role in accepting bribes to cast fraudulent ballots and certifying false voting results in primary elections in Philadelphia, prosecutors announced Thursday. Domenick J. Demuro, 73, admitted that while serving as an elected municipal Judge of Elections, he accepted bribes in exchange for adding ballots for certain candidates on the voting machines in his jurisdiction and for including the fraudulent ballots in official tallies during the 2014, 2015 and 2016 primary elections in Philadelphia. Demuro further admitted that a local political consultant paid him money to add votes for the consultant’s preferred candidates in different federal, state and local elections. Demuro said the votes he added in exchange for the political consultant’s bribes fraudulently increased the number of votes recorded and tallied for the consultant’s preferred candidates.”Florida probe finds no fraud in 2018 - Politico: “A Trump election conspiracy theory has fallen apart after Florida’s law enforcement agency said it had found no widespread voter fraud in the 2018 races for Senate and governor. President Donald Trump had complained repeatedly about election ‘fraud’ and theft in heavily populated, Democrat-rich Broward and Palm Beach counties, which had slowly but erratically updated their vote totals after polls closed on Election Day. With each updated tally, Republican candidates Rick Scott, who was running for U.S. Senate, and Ron DeSantis, in a bid for the governor’s mansion, saw their margins of victory narrow. Both races ultimately went to recounts. It’s common for election margins to change as more ballots are counted, but Scott, who was governor at the time, claimed without evidence that the counts reeked of Democratic fraud, a conspiracy theory Trump amplified on Twitter. Scott called for an investigation. Trump backed him up.”TRUMP: GOVERNORS MUST ALLOW WORSHIP SERVICESFox News: “President Trump on Friday announced that new Centers for Disease Control guidance will classify houses of worship as ‘essential,’ as he called on governors to allow them to open ‘right now’ after being closed during the coronavirus lockdowns. Trump announced the policy for churches, synagogues and mosques, during a short briefing at the White House. ‘The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important essential places of faith to open right now--for this weekend,’ Trump said. ‘If they don't do it, I will override the governors.’ ‘In America, we need more prayer not less,’ Trump said. The announcement comes after Trump has been hearing concerns of faith leaders who are unable to hold Sunday services due to coronavirus restrictions at a time when their parishioners are grappling with the crisis. Families may be grieving the loss of loved ones from the virus or struggling with job loss but unable to seek respite in their places of worship.”More cash for vaccine - NYT: “Expanding its pursuit of an inoculation against the coronavirus, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said on Thursday it would provide ‘up to $1.2 billion’ to the drug company AstraZeneca to develop a potential vaccine from a laboratory at Oxford University. The deal with AstraZeneca is the fourth and by far the largest vaccine research agreement that the department has disclosed. The money will pay for a Phase 3 clinical trial of a potential vaccine in the United States this summer with about 30,000 volunteers. The H.H.S. statement said the agency and AstraZeneca ‘are collaborating to make available at least 300 million doses,’ and projected that the first doses could be available as early as October. That is a very accelerated, ambitious timetable. Most public health experts and scientists caution that a viable, mass-produced vaccine would probably not be available until sometime next year, at the earliest. Plus, billions of doses would be needed around the world.”Noonan: What we’ve learned - WSJ: “People have suffered. They’ve been afraid. The ground on which they stand has shifted. Many have been reviewing their lives, thinking not only of ‘what’s important’ or ‘what makes me happy’ but ‘what was I designed to do?’ They’ve been conducting a kind of internal life review, reflecting on the decision that seemed small and turned out to be crucial, wondering about paths not taken, recognizing strokes of luck. They’ve been thinking about their religious faith or lack of it, about their relationships. Phone calls have been longer, love more easily expressed, its lack more admitted. It has been a dramatic time. We have stopped and thought about our lives, and our society’s arrangements. We have applauded together, for the first time, those whose jobs kept our towns up and operating, from nurses to truckers. We’ve rethought not only what is ‘essential’ but who is important. All this will change you as a nation. Here is what I am certain of. We will emerge a plainer people in a plainer country, and maybe a deeper one. Something big inside us shifted.”PLAY-BY-PLAYFox Poll: Lack of contact is biggest personal hardship of pandemic - Fox NewsAppeals court wants answers from Flynn judge on refusal to dismiss case - PoliticoSenate leaves for Memorial Day break, full agenda ready for return - Roll CallAUDIBLE: KEEP PUSHING“He always taught us that there will always be obstacles in your life.

I only answer the phone when I know who it is with caller ID. We have been like this for the last 25 years since I retired, I'm 82 now. I talk to a lot of the ‘experienced’ people around here and they do the same. So, the polls are not getting anything from the majority of the Trump supporters. Just my observation.” – Larry Braud, Baton Rouge, La.[Ed. note: You are certainly right about one thing, Mr. Braud: The birth of caller ID made life much more challenging for pollsters. But don’t imagine that folks like you are the only ones who aren’t inclined to pick up when a stranger calls. It’s a bipartisan habit. What it means is that pollsters have to call more and more numbers to get enough completed interviews and have a representative sample.

Other have done their own versions. We now have a tiki bar, cereal bar and energy bar.’ A photo of the Manchester store's booze-filled salad bar -- with the word ‘salad’ crossed out on signs so they just read ‘bar’ -- went viral after being shared on social media by customer Stephanie Hadfield. The store chain has since shared photos showing relabeled salad bars filled with candy, cereal and energy bars.”AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES…“Wounding a President by reversing his most cherished foreign policy goal is an understandable political instinct.

GOVERNORWaPo: “President Trump threatened on Monday to move the Republican National Convention out of North Carolina — while denying that he wants to hold the convention at his namesake resort in Florida even as some state officials started clamoring for the president’s adopted home state to be the venue. Accusing North Carolina’s Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, of being in a ‘shutdown mood,’ Trump — in a string of early-morning Memorial Day tweets — pressured Cooper to guarantee that ‘we will be allowed full attendance in the Arena’ in Charlotte by the late-August convention. … The threat singling out a Democratic governor who has followed federal guidelines echoed Trump’s pressure on other Democratic-led states to reopen as the coronavirus pandemic pushes the economy to the worst crisis since the Great Depression, with approximately 38 million Americans filing for unemployment and scores of businesses shuttering. Trump, who sees a revived economy as critical to his reelection, also has encouraged protests against Democratic governors who have imposed stay-at-home orders consistent with federal health officials’ recommendations.”Florida volunteers as backup - Miami Herald: “Florida Republicans said they would ‘welcome’ the Republican National Convention if President Donald Trump makes good on a Twitter threat Monday to pull the party’s seminal political event from North Carolina. ‘The Republican Party of Florida would welcome the opportunity to host the Republican National Convention,’ party Chairman Joe Gruters said in a statement. ‘Florida is committed to ensuring a safe, secure and successful event for President Trump and all attendees.’ The Republican National Committee has been planning to host its nominating convention at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte from Aug. 24-27.”Trump beefs up campaign staff after setbacks - NYT: “President Trump’s aides are promoting one of his top political advisers to deputy campaign manager, in a move to bolster the team heading into the final five months of the re-election effort, officials said on Tuesday. Bill Stepien, the former White House political director who has been working as a senior political adviser to the campaign, said in a statement that the new role will let him support both Mr. Trump and the campaign manager, Brad Parscale. ‘I will continue to support Brad Parscale as he leads the campaign, working with all of our partners in states across the country, and helping to coordinate all of our efforts to ensure the president is re-elected,’ Mr. Stepien said. The campaign is also promoting Stephanie Alexander, currently the Midwest regional political director, to the campaign chief of staff.”Trump continues to lay groundwork for fraud claims - Politico: “First he lit into Michigan and Nevada, threatening to withhold federal funding because of his assertion that both states were preparing to commit voter fraud through mail-in ballot applications. Then President Donald Trump followed up Sunday with two more broadly worded warnings that November would be ‘the greatest Rigged Election in history.’ ‘The Democrats are trying to Rig the 2020 Election, plain and simple!’ the president claimed. Trump’s increasingly amped-up rhetoric surrounding the integrity of the November election is beginning to bring to center stage a previously muted conversation. With the president lagging behind Joe Biden in public opinion polls six months before the general election, his opponents are becoming increasingly anxious that Trump may attempt to undermine the results of the election if he loses — or worse, might attempt to cling to power regardless of the outcome.”Biden comes out from lockdown for Memorial Day wreath laying - Bloomberg: “Joe Biden emerged Monday from his stay-at-home lockdown after more than 10 weeks to mark Memorial Day with a tribute to veterans. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and his wife, Jill, visited the Veterans Memorial Park at the Delaware Memorial Bridge to lay a wreath of white roses. Both wore black masks over their mouths and noses. Biden’s wearing of personal protective gear stood in contrast to President Donald Trump, who has made a show of flouting local standards by skipping a mask at events outside the White House. The visit was Biden’s first public trip since he said he would abide by the state’s coronavirus rules and the advice of health experts. He and his wife placed a wreath of white roses and stood solemnly for a moment or two of silence before walking back toward their car. ‘It feels good to be out of my house,’ he told reporters.”Whitmer’s husband caught in corona controversy - The Detroit News: “The owner of a Northern Michigan dock company says Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's husband wanted his boat placed in the water before the Memorial Day weekend as Whitmer urged residents not to rush to the region. No longer visible to the public, Facebook posts from NorthShore Dock LLC and its owner, Tad Dowker, focused on what Dowker said was a request last week by Whitmer's husband, Marc Mallory. The posts have drawn the attention of Republican state lawmakers, who said the Democratic governor's family may not be following her guidance for the rest of the state. Whitmer's spokeswoman, Tiffany Brown, didn't confirm or deny Monday the assertions by the marina company or its owner. Brown said the administration wouldn't address ‘every rumor that is spread online.’”Biden’s got the advantage in Minnesota poll - The [Minneapolis] Star Tribune: “Former Vice President Joe Biden holds a small lead over President Donald Trump among registered voters in Minnesota, according to the first presidential poll in the state since the Democrat clinched his party’s nomination. A new Minnesota Poll conducted by the Star Tribune, MPR News and KARE 11 found Biden ahead of Trump 49% to 44% in the general election matchup less than six months ahead of Election Day. Biden fell just short of a majority, but 7% of Minnesotans said they are still undecided. The poll also found that statewide, 53% of voters disapprove of the Republican incumbent’s job performance as president, compared with 45% who approve. Only 2% were undecided about Trump, reflecting a high degree of polarization heading into the fall election season.”SESSIONS SASSESAL.com: “A Twitter battle between President Donald Trump and his former attorney general spilled into Saturday, with Jeff Sessions defending his support among conservatives and the president later on Sessions to withdraw from the Alabama senate race. Trump, in his Saturday evening tweet, called on Sessions to drop out of the race for Senate and ‘pray’ that Democratic U.S. Senator Doug Jones loses in November. … Sessions, late Saturday, said he will ‘never apologize for following the law’ and defended his decision in 2017 to recuse himself from the U.S. Department of Justice’s investigation into Russia’s interference into the 2016 presidential election. … Sessions, in the Friday night Tweet, told Trump he did his duty and ‘you’re damn fortunate I did. I protected the rule of law & resulted in your exoneration.’ Sessions responded after Trump tweeted earlier on Friday his support for [Tommy] Tuberville.”King’s primary challenger eschews bigotry claims - AP: “Rep. Steve King is fighting for his political life — but not because he’s compared immigrants crossing the border illegally to cattle. His Republican opponents in next week’s primary aren’t raking him over the coals for making light of rape and incest. His chief rival’s ads don’t mention the time he wondered when the term ‘white supremacist’ became offensive. Instead, the nine-term congressman known for his nativist politics is fighting to prove he can still deliver for Iowa’s 4th Congressional District. Since Republican leaders stripped him of his committee assignments, in a rare punishment, King has been dogged by questions over whether he’s lost all effectiveness. Some longtime supporters are turning away, not because of his incendiary remarks but because they think he can no longer do the job.”House Dems spend $18.3 million for fall TV ads - Roll Call: “With less than six months before Election Day, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has reserved more than $18.3 million in airtime for broadcast television ads during the final months of the campaign. It’s likely the first of multiple rounds of reservations, considering the committee’s independent expenditure arm spent more than $73 million on TV during the 2018 cycle. This initial round of reservations overlap with the Senate and presidential battleground states, including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada and Pennsylvania, where media markets are likely to get crowded and expensive. Back in April, the two biggest partisan super PACs — the GOP-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund ($51 million) and Democratic-aligned House Majority PAC ($43 million) — placed nearly $100 million combined in initial ad reservations. The National Republican Congressional Committee hasn’t made its initial ad reservations.”Florida’s poll tax for felons struck down - Politico: “A federal judge on Sunday dismantled Florida’s restrictive felon voting rights law in a ruling that could open the door to hundreds of thousands of new voters being added to rolls just ahead of the 2020 presidential election. U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle declared key portions of the state’s felon voting law unconstitutional, ordering the state to put in place a new process that would help people register to vote in the state. Throughout his 125-page ruling, Hinkle chided the state for a ‘pay-to-vote’ system that he said was Byzantine because, in some instances, former felons could not even figure how much money they owed.”Judge rules S.C. voters don’t need a witness for absentee ballots - AP: “A federal judge says people voting by absentee ballot in South Carolina don’t have to have a witness sign the voting papers. U.S. District Judge J. Michelle Childs on Monday ordered South Carolina officials to not enforce the requirement for a witness signature on ballots in the June 9 primary or any ensuing runoff elections. She said having to seek a witness increases the chance that a voter would contract or spread the coronavirus. Childs, however, did not permanently strike down the requirement as unconstitutional. ‘The evidence in the record points to the conclusion that adherence to the witness requirement in June would only increase the risk for contracting COVID-19 for members of the public with underlying medical conditions, the disabled, and racial and ethnic minorities,’ the judge wrote in her order.”PLAY-BY-PLAYPergram: Campaign rhetoric avoids complexity and reality - Fox NewsLibertarian Party nominates Jo Jorgensen for presidential nomination - ReasonMeatpackers’ virus woes deepen, prompting new scarcity concerns - WaPoJessica Melugin: Presidential panel on social media bias misfires - Competitive Enterprise InstituteAUDIBLE: ADULTING“Forty-five thousand young people — the biggest student population we’ve ever had — are telling us they want to be here this fall. To tell them, ‘Sorry, we are too incompetent or too fearful to figure out how to protect your elders, so you have to disrupt your education,’ would be a gross disservice to them and a default of our responsibility.” – Mitch Daniels, the former governor of Indiana who is now the president of Purdue University, writing about his decision to convene the fall semester with in-person classes.FROM THE BLEACHERS“Come on man. ‘The good news is, our great pollsters are able to figure it out and provide reliable, predictive products.’ Mr. Braud [in Friday’s Halftime Report] is 100% correct. Seems you have forgotten the 2016 Election Cycle. Are your ‘great pollsters’ factoring in that silent Trump supporter this time around?” – Al DiStefano, Cumming, Ga.[Ed. note: You have been a pretty regular correspondent for quite a while, Mr. DiStefano, and I’m pretty certain that this isn’t your first complaint about polling, so please forgive me if I am repeating myself. There is no evidence of “silent Trump” supporters. Quite the contrary. There is lots of evidence that Trump supporters proudly and enthusiastically proclaim their allegiance. Polls in 2016 were more accurate than they were in 2012 when pre-election surveys understated support for Barack Obama by more than three points on average. Would we say that there was a “silent” Obama vote? We would instead say that the polling missed a bit, but generally got the shape of the race right -- just as it did in 2016. And I feel certain that I’ve told you this before, so forgive me for repeating: Don’t place so much emphasis on polling. It’s just one tool we have for watching the race unfold. I hope that will keep you in good stead for the rest of this cycle.]","1617285793","1");

Plus, Chris takes a shot at political scandal trivia. LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE HEREBIDEN PROMISES VEEP PICK BY AUGUSTThe Hill: “Former Vice President Joe Biden says he hopes to decide on a running mate by Aug. 1, about two weeks before the Democratic nominating convention in Milwaukee. Speaking at a digital fundraiser hosted by former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Biden said his campaign’s vice presidential committee has already interviewed the contenders on his shortlist. ‘We’re in the process of deciding the basic cut — about whether or not they really want it,’ Biden said. ‘Are they comfortable? They’ve asked a lot of questions.’ … Biden said he’s looking for someone he is comfortable with, as opposed to an ideological ally.”Greenberg still likes Warren - Politico: “Stan Greenberg, one of the Democratic Party's longtime leading pollsters, urged Hillary Clinton in 2016 to pick Elizabeth Warren as her vice president. He thinks Clinton would be president had she listened. Now Greenberg — who popularized the term ‘Reagan Democrats’ and came to prominence as Bill Clinton’s lead pollster — is urging Joe Biden’s team to heed the same advice. Earlier this month, he briefed top Biden campaign officials on two battleground surveys conducted by his firm. Accompanied by a slide presentation that was obtained by POLITICO, Greenberg addressed the question hanging over Biden and his inner circle: Which vice presidential candidate will help the most in November? The conclusion was blunt: ‘Sen. Warren is the obvious solution.’ Biden’s biggest problem, Greenberg said, is that the Democratic Party has not unified behind him.African-American activists dig in against Klobuchar - Fox News: “African-American activists are escalating their efforts to persuade former Vice President Joe Biden not to name Sen. Amy Klobuchar as his running mate, arguing he needs to choose someone who would excite black voters. Those efforts come amid the national spotlight on the case of a black man in Minnesota who died on Monday after being pinned to the ground by a Minneapolis police officer who had his knee to man’s neck. That situation appears to be turning up the volume on calls for Biden not to choose Klobuchar. Klobuchar – the Minnesota senator who didn't resonate with black voters during her bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination – was already being criticized by activists as a choice that would not motivate black voters to support Biden in November’s general election. African-Americans are a key part of the Democratic Party’s base.”Biden builds out campaign - WaPo: “Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has hired two aides to helm a new coalitions department modeled on President Barack Obama’s reelection strategy, a campaign expansion that adds more racial diversity to his effort to win the White House. Ashley Allison, a veteran of the Obama White House who is African American, is joining the Biden campaign as national coalitions director. Her deputy will be Jason Rodriguez, who served as the national deputy Latino vote director for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and has worked with the Congressional Black Caucus. The moves come amid a broader expansion of the Biden campaign, which included a doubling of his digital staff and new hires in fundraising and organizing. Staffing up will continue and will increase significantly in June, according to Biden’s campaign manager, Jen O’Malley Dillon.”Biden to participate in Texas' virtual-convention - Axios: “Joe Biden will help close out the Texas Democratic Party's all-virtual convention next week as one of the event’s major speakers. The coronavirus is changing conventions as we know them. Given Texas' size, the event could serve as a test run of sorts for large-scale virtual events, as planners consider whether at least some aspects of the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee in August should be virtual. The Texas Democratic Party has been in contact with the Democratic National Convention throughout their planning process, a party official said, sharing best practices on how to host an online event of this size. To avoid any technical difficulties, speakers are pre-recording their videos for the convention, which will play throughout the nine-hour livestream on June 1. Biden is expected to address the importance of turning Texas blue and Texas' status as a battleground state in his video. Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke will also join as a featured speaker.”New anti-Trump GOP group set to spend $10 million - NYT: “…[A] new effort called Republican Voters Against Trump is hoping to chip away at Mr. Trump’s support from white, college-educated Republican voters in the suburbs, hoping a more surgical approach will help to elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., his expected Democratic opponent. The new group is set to begin a $10 million digital and television advertising campaign that will use personal stories of conservative voters giving voice to their deep — and sometimes brand-new — dissatisfaction with the president. The group will test the premise of whether there are really any persuadable voters left in a deeply tribal moment in American politics, in which views of Mr. Trump, both positive and negative, have only been hardened over the past four years.”BADGER STATE CLOSE TO DEAL ON MAIL-IN RULESMilwaukee Journal Sentinel: “Wisconsin election officials agreed Wednesday to send absentee ballot applications to most voters this fall, but the plan could face obstacles next month if Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on the wording of the mailing. The members of the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission voted 6-0 to advance the plan a week after they failed to reach consensus on who should receive ballot applications. Under the commission's plan, the state will not send actual absentee ballots, but rather the forms voters can use to request them. If voters filled out those forms and provided a copy of a photo ID, they would receive an absentee ballot for the Nov. 3 presidential election.”Texas digs in against corona absentee ballots - Texas Tribune: “The Texas Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a lack of immunity to the new coronavirus does not qualify a voter to apply for a mail-in ballot. In the latest twist in the legal fight over voting by mail during the coronavirus pandemic, the court agreed with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton that the risk of contracting the virus alone does not meet the state’s qualifications for voting by mail. ‘We agree with the State that a voter’s lack of immunity to COVID-19, without more, is not a ‘disability’ as defined by the Election Code,’ the court wrote. Texas voters can qualify for mail-in ballots only if they are 65 years or older, have a disability or illness, will be out of the county during the election period, or are confined in jail. The Texas election code defines disability as a ‘sickness or physical condition’ that prevents a voter from appearing in person without the risk of ‘injuring the voter’s health.’”ANTI-TERROR MEASURES IN DOUBT AFTER BREAKDOWNFox News: “House Democrats scrapped plans to vote on a bipartisan bill to reauthorize national security surveillance tools after President Trump issued a veto threat on Twitter Wednesday night. Democrats had already postponed a vote slated for Wednesday because of earlier objections from the president, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer officially pulled the bill from consideration Thursday morning when it became clear that House Republicans would no longer back the bill. ‘The President tweeted that he would veto the bill, and House Republicans abandoned their support for our national security,’ Pelosi said a statement Thursday after Hoyer announced the vote was off. The planned vote was to reauthorize Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) provisions and enact more reforms to safeguard civil liberties. The House was to take up the Senate measure that passed 80-16 to reauthorize lapsed provisions and revise how the Justice Department and FBI use the tools designed to fight terrorism.”Compromise talks on business loan terms continue - Roll Call: “A Republican lawmaker said Wednesday that negotiators agreed to adjust a key ratio in a program to relieve small businesses from the COVID-19 pandemic, lowering to 60 percent the portion of loans that must be used for payroll, from 75 percent currently, and giving borrowers more time to use any loans. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, the sponsor of a bill that is scheduled for a House floor vote Thursday, told CQ Roll Call that he expects House and Senate leaders to reach a deal on how small businesses can use a $660 billion lifeline provided in two previous economic relief laws through the Paycheck Protection Program administered by the Small Business Administration.  … The bill would reduce an administration requirement that 75 percent of PPP loan funds be used for payroll.”JOBLESS CLAIMS TOP 40 MILLION IN 10 WEEKSPolitico: “Workers filed 2.1 million new unemployment claims last week, the Department of Labor reported, suggesting about a quarter of the workforce is seeking jobless aid to weather the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus. The latest figure indicates that the pandemic has pushed 40.8 million Americans out of work in just 10 weeks. DOL also reported that another 1.2 million people applied for benefits under the new temporary Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program created for individuals who are typically ineligible for unemployment insurance, such as self-employed workers. With those people added, the raw unadjusted number of claims filed last week could be as high as 3.1 million, though there could be some overlap between the new program and traditional unemployment benefits. … California saw the highest number of new claims last week, reporting an estimated 212,343 new applications filed. New York followed with an estimated 192,193 new claims.”White House shelves economic forecast amid bad news - Fox News: “The White House has decided against releasing a new round of updated economic projections this summer in an unprecedented move as the country continues to reel financially from the coronavirus-spurred downturn. The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), the internal White House economic team, will not send out their projections this summer – despite assurances from a number of top Trump administration advisers that the economy will swiftly recover from the worst downturn since the Great Depression. The numbers are normally produced jointly by the Office of Management and Budget, CEA and Treasury Department. … The Labor Department report included a positive sign: The number of people now receiving benefits fell for the first time since the outbreak intensified in mid-March, from 25 million to 21 million. That suggests companies are starting to rehire and could mean that total job losses will peak in May.”PLAY-BY-PLAYThe Judge’s Ruling: Coronavirus shutdowns ordered by governors and mayors are unconstitutional - Fox NewsAUDIBLE: THE TURTLE IN NO HURRY “I just think it’s too early to make a final judgment about how much or when, but I think about a month from now we’ll take a look at how things are going and be able to make a more intelligent decision than a grab-bag of $3 trillion that (the House) threw together.” –Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s response when asked how much money Congress should spend on the next coronavirus relief bill.FROM THE BLEACHERS","1619358078","1");

Her lecture tours took her several times around the world, and she did much to remove the stigmas and ignorance surrounding sight and hearing disorders, which historically had often resulted in the committal of the blind and deaf to asylums. Helen Keller was also outspoken in other areas and supported socialism all her life.

Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference with law enforcement and national security officials, telling the local leaders they ‘have to get much tougher’ amid nationwide protests and criticizing their responses. ‘Most of you are weak,’ Trump said. ‘You have to arrest people.’ … The president urged the governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited for helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis. He demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced a spasm of violence, like New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. ‘You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again,’ said Trump. ‘We’re doing it in Washington, D.C. We’re going to do something that people haven’t seen before.’”Trump waited out riot in bunker - NYT: “Inside the White House, the mood was bristling with tension. Hundreds of protesters were gathering outside the gates, shouting curses at President Trump and in some cases throwing bricks and bottles. Nervous for his safety, Secret Service agents abruptly rushed the president to the underground bunker used in the past during terrorist attacks. … After days in which the empathy he expressed for George Floyd, the man killed, was overshadowed by his combative threats to ramp up violence against looters and rioters, Mr. Trump spent Sunday out of sight, even as some of his campaign advisers were recommending that he deliver a nationally televised address before another night of violence. The building was even emptier than usual as some White House officials planning to work were told not to come in case of renewed unrest.”Biden heads to black church for meeting on killings, riots - AP: “Joe Biden vowed to address ‘institutional racism’ in his first 100 days in office as he met with community leaders at a predominantly African American church in Delaware Monday morning, leaving home for a second consecutive day to address exploding racial tensions that have begun to reshape the upcoming presidential election. … But after another night of violent protests, the 77-year-old Democrat gathered with roughly a dozen local black leaders during an intimate meeting in his hometown ahead of a virtual meeting with mayors from Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago and St. Paul, Minnesota. ‘Hate just hides. It doesn't go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,’ Biden said, his face mask lowered around his chin, after several participants shared their thoughts on police brutality. If elected, he promised to ‘deal with institutional racism’ and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office.”Greg Sargent: Biden may disappoint activists - WaPo: “With protests spreading across the country, President Trump’s advisers at first urged him on Sunday night to give a nationally televised address. But they ultimately calculated this wasn’t a good idea, because he didn’t have anything new to say or announce. … The extraordinary vacuum of leadership this has created gives Joe Biden a big opening. But how will he use it? Biden advisers tell me we can expect a few things. First, they say, we can expect Biden to place more emphasis in coming days on the need for more expansive use of the Justice Department to crack down on systemic police department racism and abuses. … Second, they say, we can expect more of an effort from Biden to speak to the nation in the manner he believes a president should do at a moment like this. … After talking to the Biden campaign, I’m persuaded that they reject this fundamental premise, though they may not prove willing to go as far in proposing reform as some might want.”BIDEN CLOSING IN ON MAGIC NUMBERFox News: “The former vice president currently has 1,566 delegates to [Bernie] Sanders' 1,007. Biden needs 425 more delegates to secure the 1,991 majority of delegates needed to win the nomination, a total he can theoretically secure on Tuesday. Among the seven states that vote in the Democratic presidential primary Tuesday – Iowa, which holds the first-in-the-nation caucuses, is holding its primary for non-presidential offices – there are 479 delegates available. Biden, the only game in town, could theoretically lace up the Democratic nomination if he gets 425 or more of those delegates. But voters can still select candidates besides Biden on their ballots, and Sanders has previously said he still hopes to amass delegates in the later primaries in a bid to gain influence at the Democratic convention later this year.”Other races to watch Tuesday - USA Today: “The primary in Iowa's 4th Congressional District will determine whether Republican voters in this largely rural district spanning northwest Iowa return Rep. Steve King to office. … Iowa has a competitive Democratic primary for the nomination to take on Republican incumbent Sen. Joni Ernst. … Ernst's seat is seen by some analysts as a pick-up opportunity for Democrats looking to take back the Senate. … New Mexico's Second Congressional District sprawls across the southern half of the state and is represented by Democratic Rep. Xochitl Torres Small.  Republicans eye the district as a potential pickup opportunity given its general Republican lean. … [New Mexico’s] Third Congressional District has attracted a crowded field of Democratic candidates to succeed Rep. Ben Ray Luján, who is running for Senate. … Maryland, which rescheduled its primaries from April 28, will vote in several congressional primaries on Tuesday.”PLAY-BY-PLAYN.C.

Ms. Murkowski said the critique by General Mattis, in which he said that Mr. Trump had divided the nation and failed to lead, was overdue and might be a tipping point that would cause Republicans to air concerns about the president that they had only spoken about privately. ‘I was really thankful,’ Ms. Murkowski told reporters on Capitol Hill. ‘I thought General Mattis’s words were true and honest and necessary and overdue.’ The comments by Ms. Murkowski, one of the few moderate Republicans in Congress who has been willing to break with Mr. Trump, suggested that his response to nationwide unrest over police brutality and racial discrimination had prodded at least some members of the party to reconsider their support for him.”Yuval Levin: ‘The Evils of Injustice and the Danger of Mobocracy’ - National Review: “In recent days, my mind has turned to Abraham Lincoln—maybe the greatest of the great-souled Americans. I’ve thought of him not only because he thought and acted with such moral clarity regarding the evil of racism and the inhumanity of slavery, but also because he understood that no just society was possible without respect for basic social order. He knew there was an ideal of justice above the law, and he knew that it could only be respected and put into effect through the law, not around it. … We incline to worry about angry mobs out of fear that they will harm the innocent, but Lincoln argued that even when their cause is understandable (even when, as in one of his examples, they are rightly livid at ‘the perpetration of an outrageous murder’), their lawlessness is a grave danger, because they ultimately liberate ‘the lawless in spirit…to become lawless in practice,’ and then leave good citizens with no choice but to become lawless in their own defense.”The Judge’s Ruling: ‘America is under attack from three deadly viruses’ - Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano takes the national temperature in his column this week: “America is under attack by three deadly viruses. COVID-19 has killed more than 107,000 Americans since March. Yet, it pales in comparison to the virus it provoked -- hubris. And that, in turn, provoked the virus that has bedeviled America since the 17th century -- racism.” Read it all here.AMID RE-ELECTION WOES, TRUMP CALLS CAMPAIGN TO CARPETBloomberg: “President Donald Trump has summoned top political advisers including his re-election campaign manager, Brad Parscale, for a White House meeting as his political standing erodes in key battleground states, according to people familiar with the matter. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who is the de facto leader of his re-election effort, will also participate, the people said, as will Deputy Campaign Manager Bill Stepien and Trump’s top pollster, Tony Fabrizio. One of the people said it’s expected to be a tense meeting, describing internal polls that show Trump performing poorly in politically competitive states across the country. The people asked not to be identified because the meeting isn’t on Trump’s public schedule for the day. Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows is also in the meeting, another person said.”Internal campaign polling alarms Team Trump - NYT: “In private polling conducted by Mr. Trump’s campaign, the president is now well behind Mr. Biden, according to people briefed on the most recent round of results. Multiple public surveys this week have found Mr. Trump trailing Mr. Biden, the former vice president, by double-digit margins, including a Monmouth University poll published on Wednesday that showed Mr. Biden ahead by 11 percentage points. The presidential election is still five months away and Mr. Trump, despite his political vulnerability, retains some important assets as a candidate. While Mr. Biden’s fund-raising efforts have picked up momentum, Mr. Trump is sitting on a considerably larger war chest and is resuming in-person fund-raising next week. There is almost no open dissent within the Republican Party, giving Mr. Trump a solid political foundation on the right from which he can attempt to rebuild his strength before the fall campaign.”Biden nearly doubles Wisconsin lead - Fox News: “Majorities of Wisconsin voters rate the economy negatively and are concerned about coronavirus. That helps explain Democrat Joe Biden’s gains in the presidential race, in a Fox News Poll of Wisconsin registered voters released Wednesday. Biden has a 9-point edge over President Donald Trump, 49-40 percent. That’s up from a 5-point advantage in January, and is outside the poll’s margin of sampling error.  Another 11 percent are uncommitted. A big reason Trump trails Biden is lack of party support: 85 percent of Republicans back him, while 93 percent of Democrats support Biden.  Eight percent of Republicans defect to Biden.  In addition, only 87 percent of those who approve of Trump’s job performance support his reelection.”Ohio back to swing state status as Biden holds narrow lead - Fox News: “A Fox News Poll of Ohio registered voters finds Democrat Joe Biden narrowly tops President Donald Trump in the race for the White House.  At the same time, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine enjoys sky-high, bipartisan approval. Biden is ahead of Trump by a 45 to 43 percent margin. The former vice president’s 2-point edge is within the poll’s margin of sampling error. Voters extremely interested in the election go for Biden by 6 points (51-45 percent). More Democrats (61 percent) than Republicans (55 percent) are extremely interested in the election.”Biden up 4 in Arizona, McSally getting shellacked - Fox News: “Republicans are rightly concerned about Arizona. A new Fox News Poll finds the state shading blue -- especially in the race for the U.S. Senate, where Democrat Mark Kelly bests incumbent Republican Sen. Martha McSally by a 50-37 percent margin among Arizona registered voters. The story here is party loyalty. Some 88 percent of Democrats back Kelly, while just 73 percent of Republicans support McSally.  Fully 13 percent of those backing President Trump in the presidential race cross over and go for Kelly. Gov. Doug Ducey appointed McSally after the 2018 retirement of Sen. John McCain’s successor, Jon Kyl. In a head-to-head presidential ballot test, Democrat Joe Biden edges President Donald Trump by 46-42 percent.  Another 11 percent are still up for grabs. Biden’s 4-point advantage is within the poll’s margin of sampling error.”Texas tight, but undecideds aplenty - Quinnipiac University: “President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden are locked in a very tight race in Texas, with Trump receiving 44 percent of the vote and Biden receiving 43 percent in a general election matchup, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released [Wednesday]. Democrats go for Biden 90 - 5 percent, independents do the same 45 - 36 percent, and Republicans go for Trump 87 - 6 percent. Voters say 54 - 40 percent that Trump would do a better job handling the economy, but say 49 - 43 percent that Biden would do a better job handling health care. Voters are split on who would do a better job handling the response to the coronavirus, as 47 percent say Biden and 45 percent say Trump.”Trump approval on race relations hits 33 percent - CBS News: “President Trump's overall approval rating stands at 40% and disapproval is 54% — both within the historically narrow range in which they vary; neither his lowest nor highest numbers. As always, given high marks from Republicans and faring worse among others. Even fewer approve of his handling of race relations specifically, at 33%. Here again, his own party bolsters the numbers, with 72% of Republicans approving. African-Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the president's overall job performance and his handling of race relations. The public has similarly negative views on the president's response to the situation in Minneapolis: 31% are satisfied with it, while 55% dissatisfied with it.”BIDEN FACES BACKLASH FROM POLICE UNIONSPolitico: “Joe Biden has long prided himself on being a union-friendly Democrat with a good relationship with rank-and-file cops. But Biden’s call for more national policing reforms and oversight in the wake of the death of George Floyd — and the perception that he hasn’t shown enough solidarity with law enforcement amid the ensuing nationwide protests and unrest — have created a fissure with law enforcement groups, leaving many who once supported him frustrated by what they regard as political posturing by their one-time ally. ‘Clearly, he’s made a lot of changes the way candidates do during the primary process, but he kept moving left and fell off the deep end,’ said Bill Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, the umbrella organization for Police Benevolent Association chapters. … As the two presidential candidates confront one of the most racially combustible moments in recent history, they are taking decidedly different tacks.”Bernie bros not so friendly - Politico: “Bernie world is tearing itself apart. As election results across the country rolled in on Tuesday evening, current and former aides to Bernie Sanders abruptly laced into each other on social media, trading accusations of being ‘tone-deaf,’ not giving ‘a shit about the base,’ and even stealing infrastructure from the 2020 campaign. The clashes made public tensions that had long simmered below the surface among different factions in Sanders’ team during the primary. But they also demonstrated how difficult it is for top Sanders lieutenants to control even their own former staffers, which could hamper efforts at party unity during the general election. For progressives and ex-Sanders staffers worried about how to keep the movement alive after the Vermont senator dropped out of the primary, the feud set off a round of soul-searching since it came against the backdrop of nationwide civil unrest and protests against police brutality.”Ocasio-Cortez backs Engel’s challenger in primary - Fox News: “Despite a less-than-stellar record on past endorsements, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said Wednesday that she was going to throw her support behind Rep. Eliot Engel’s primary challenger. ‘This moment requires renewed and revitalized leadership across the country AND at the ballot box,’ she tweeted, as she lent her support to Jamaal Bowman, an educator. Earlier this year, Ocasio-Cortez announced the Courage to Change PAC, which was seen at the time as a threat to established Democrats. Despite her freshman status in the House, she is popular and her endorsement is seen as a gateway to the younger vote. Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, once called Ocasio-Cortez one of the most powerful politicians in Washington. She called Bowman, who is African-American, ‘a profound community leader.’ Engel’s district has mostly black and Hispanic voters.”TWO MILLION MORE LAYOFFS HINT AT DIRE LABOR REPORTPolitico: “U.S. workers filed another 1.9 million new claims for unemployment benefits last week, the Department of Labor reported. The coronavirus pandemic has forced roughly 42.6 million workers onto jobless rolls in just 11 weeks. Another 623,000 people applied for benefits under the new temporary Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program created for people who are ineligible for traditional unemployment benefits, suggesting the number of claims filed last week could be higher than 2 million. But there is likely some overlap between the claims reported for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and normal state programs. ‘Even as states reopen, claims in the millions are an indicator that the economic pain of the COVID-19 crisis is still acute,’ Glassdoor Senior Economist Daniel Zhao said in reaction to the claims number.”GOP under pressure to extend unemployment benefits - Politico: “Forty million Americans are unemployed and extra unemployment benefits expire at the end of next month. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans are grappling with deep ideological divisions over what to do with the popular program in the middle of a pandemic and an election year. Most Republicans have roundly rejected the House Democrats’ approach of extending a $600 weekly boost to unemployment checks though January 2021, and some say the enhanced benefits may need to end altogether. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said ‘it might’ need to go back to the normal state unemployment benefits, and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said the additional funds were a ‘terrible idea [that] never should have passed in the first place.’ Many Republicans think the extra money makes it less enticing for Americans to go back to work — already a concern for people considering the dangers of being infected by coronavirus in the workplace.”AUDIBLE: LIFT THE SHADOW“Progress comes when people treat one another with respect, as if we were color-blind. Unless and until we are honest that race is still an anchor around our country’s neck, that shadow will never be lifted.” – Condoleezza Rice in an opinion piece for the WaPo.FROM THE BLEACHERS“Chris, honest question, with all of the predictable blame-assigning in recent days arising from the horrific homicide of George Floyd, there is one group I have not yet heard anyone mention - the police union. Derek Chauvin was a police officer with 18 prior complaints investigated by Internal Affairs, two of which resulted in discipline. There is no way to know if some of the complaints were reduced in severity as a part of a settlement. At minimum, Chauvin seems, over the years, to have had issues in doing his job professionally. I understand that Chief Arradando, appointed following another high-profile police shooting in 2017, seems well regarded and sincere in his reform plan for the department’s relationship to the community. Assuming Arradondo’s efforts included eliminating ‘bad apples’ from the force, I wonder to what extent the police union might make it difficult to impossible to remove a problematic sworn officer from such a powerful position in which he can do so much harm? This seems like it could be an issue in other locales as well.” – Jim Snave, Wilmington, N.C.[Ed. note: Since the days when Calvin Coolidge as governor of Massachusetts broke the Boston police strike, police unions have been one of the stickiest wickets in American public life. Through most of the 20th century, Democratic leaders in big cities sided with police unions not just on increased pay and benefits but also on discipline. Like other government-worker unions, they were part of machines that protected the existing power structure. It wasn’t until this week that Philadelphia took down a hideously heroic statue of Frank Rizzo, the former police commissioner turned mayor who famously told his supporters to “vote white.” As cities changed radically in the ensuing decades, the relationship became more fraught and Republicans, especially big-city GOPers of an authoritarian bent, found common cause. The power of police unions is not just in contributions and endorsements, but their power to undercut elected officials. No one, Republican or Democrat, would like to run for office branded as soft on crime. But on the other hand, without organization, police officers have often been subject to abuses by civilian leaders and politically-motivated changes to standards and procedures. City leaders have long struggled with finding the right balance between protecting the members of the thin blue line and holding officers accountable.]“In light of the current racial tensions I have been thinking about your argument that the number of House of Representatives should be increased so that each Representative actually represents fewer people. Do you think this would help minorities have a louder voice in the House, because the districts would be smaller and the Reps closer to the population they represent? How big does it need to be so that this theory is effective? This would also increase the Electoral College, correct? Would that benefit some States over the others? My initial thought was no, because the Reps would still be allocated based on population so the Electoral Votes would still be basically the same percentage per State. I realize that having more/better representation in government is not the solution to racial tensions & racism, but I do think it could be a puzzle piece of the solution.  We can at least start a conversation on how we can help our fellow Americans be heard. God Bless.” – Colleen Mansuetto, Cleveland[Ed. note: Wow, Ms. Mansuetto! I hadn’t even thought about that one. Good looking out!

That means certain elective medical procedures could resume, including Botox injections and cosmetic surgery. Michael Salzhauer, a plastic surgeon known as ‘Dr. Miami’ who has also starred in a reality television show, has been conducting drive-through Botox injections in the garage of his building in the posh Miami neighborhood of Bal Harbour. Salzhauer said the idea struck him as he was sitting in his car waiting for a blood test for COVID-19 antibodies. ‘The areas that we inject Botox are the upper face, exactly the parts of the face that aren’t covered by the mask so it’s really ideal,’ Salzhauer said, while wearing a mask, face shield and surgical gown as he waited for his next drive-up patient.

Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made the remarks in a prerecorded graduation speech to students at the National Defense University. Milley advised the students that it is important to keep ‘a keen sense of situational awareness’ and acknowledged his failure to do so on June 1, as he walked from Lafayette Square in combat fatigues alongside the president, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and other senior advisers. ‘As many of you saw the results of the photograph of me in Lafayette Square last week, that sparked a national debate about the role of the military in civil society,’ Milley said.”Trump to resume rallies on friendly turf in Oklahoma - USA Today: “President Donald Trump said Wednesday he plans to headline his first political rallies of the COVID-19 era in five states in the weeks ahead, at least three of them key battlegrounds that could decide whether he remains in the White House. Revivals of his signature political events will begin in Oklahoma, Florida, Texas, Arizona and North Carolina, Trump said, previewing a new phase in a race in which he has fallen behind Democratic challenger Joe Biden in several states – the main reason the president is eager to get back on the road. ‘We're going to start our rallies back up now,’ Trump told reporters at the White House. ‘We've had a tremendous run at rallies. ... It's been an amazing thing to behold.’ Trump plans to return to the stage on June 19 – a week from Friday – at a ‘beautiful new venue’ in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a state that is considered very friendly to him.”Courts controversy with Juneteenth date - AP: “The rally will take place on Juneteenth, the commemoration of the ending of slavery in the United States. Tulsa has its own troubling history on race. Its once-thriving African American business community was decimated in 1921, when a racist white mob killed hundreds of black residents. Black residents attempted to rebuild in the decades that followed, only to see their work erased during urban renewal of the 1960s.”Gets back on the campaign cash hustle - AP: “President Donald Trump is resuming in-person fundraising events after a three-month hiatus as his campaign works to maintain a cash advantage over Democrat Joe Biden that it believes is vital to victory in November. Trump is traveling to Dallas on Thursday to raise more than $10 million for his campaign and the Republican Party, according to a GOP official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the plan. He’ll hold another event Saturday at his private golf course in New Jersey. The moves come at a critical moment in the campaign. Trump’s reelection plans have been rocked by the coronavirus pandemic, a severe economic recession and weeks of nationwide protests over racial injustice. That’s added to a sense of urgency to build on the more than $250 million Trump already has in the bank to overcome stiff headwinds.”Inhoffe looks to claw back commission on removing Confederate names - Roll Call: “Oklahoma Republican James M.

The committee approved a fiscal 2021 defense authorization bill, or NDAA, on Wednesday evening. The measure includes an amendment by Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., that would establish a commission that would make recommendations on how, not whether, to change the names of bases, ships and more. The commission would have up to three years to work. The committee adopted the amendment by voice vote during it's closed-door deliberations. But Inhofe told reporters he does not agree with the provision, and he indicated precisely how he might try to weaken it, either on the Senate floor or in conference.”Lawmaker wondered if COVID rates for ‘colored’ Ohioans due to bad hygiene - The Columbus Dispatch: “During a hearing Tuesday on whether to declare racism a public health crisis in Ohio, a GOP state senator referred to ‘the colored population’ and questioned whether they get COVID-19 more often because they do not wash their hands as much. During a discussion with Angela Dawson, executive director of the Ohio Commission on Minority Health, Sen. Steve Huffman, a doctor from Tipp City north of Dayton, said, ‘I understand that African Americans have a higher incidence of prior conditions and that makes them more susceptible to COVID, but does not make them more susceptible just to get COVID.’ ‘We know it’s twice as often, correct? Could it just be that African Americans – the colored population — do not wash their hands as well as other groups? Or wear a mask? Or do not socially distance themselves? Could that just be maybe the explanation of why there’s a higher incidence?’”Henninger: ‘The media’s self-censors’ - WSJ: “In the past week, the editorial page editor of the New York Times, the editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer and the editors of Bon Appétit magazine and the young women’s website Refinery 29 have been forced out by the staff and owners of their publications for offenses regarded as at odds with the beliefs of the current protests. It is impossible not to recognize the irony of these events. The silencers aren’t campus protesters but professional journalists, a class of American workers who for nearly 250 years have had a constitutionally protected and court-enforced ability to say just about anything they want. Historically, people have been attracted to American journalism because it was the freest imaginable place to work for determined, often quirky individualists. Suddenly, it looks like the opposite of that.”ANOTHER 1.5 MILLION LAID OFF WaPo: “Another 1.5 million people applied for unemployment insurance for the first time last week, adding to the tens of millions of people who have applied for the insurance since the pandemic began and continuing a months-long drop in the number of initial claims. The numbers remain at historically high levels. The number gig and formerly self-employed workers that applied for the supplemental insurance that is newly available for them went up to 705,000, from 620,000 the week before, under the expanded federal program that grants them benefits. More than 40 million people have applied for unemployment benefits during the pandemic, a sky-high toll that paints a picture of the economic devastation that the coronavirus and the shutdowns that have helped contain it have left in their wake. The numbers add to the complicated economic outlook that the United States faces as it works to reopen for business while containing further spread of the virus at the same time.”Fed warns of years-long struggle - NYT: “The head of the Federal Reserve on Wednesday offered a grim assessment of how quickly the U.S. economy will recover from its pandemic-induced recession, suggesting that millions of people could remain out of work for an extended period as central bank officials estimated unemployment will be at 9.3 percent by the end of 2020. The Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, said the labor market might have ‘hit bottom’ after recording a 14.7 percent unemployment rate in April, but made clear that it was too soon to know for certain. ‘This is the biggest economic shock, in the U.S. and the world, really, in living memory,’ Mr. Powell said… The sober projections, the Fed’s first estimates of 2020, depicted a very different economic path from the quick ‘V-shaped recovery’ that President Trump has suggested is underway as he pushes states to reopen and remove the stay-at-home orders that have contributed to bringing business activity to a halt.”Virus surge continues - NPR: “The U.S. has reached another dire landmark in its fight against COVID-19, surpassing 2 million confirmed cases on Wednesday. New coronavirus infections are rising in at least 20 states, even as restrictions on daily life continue to ease across the country. As of Thursday morning, more than 112,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S. — the most fatalities reported by any nation, according to a tracker from Johns Hopkins University. And most experts believe those numbers underestimate the true toll. The latest data also reflects the difficulty of quashing the coronavirus. While some early hot spots such as New York state have seen a sustained drop in new cases, COVID-19 hospitalizations have swelled recently in places like Texas, Arizona, Arkansas and California. Texas set new records for COVID-19 hospitalizations on three consecutive days this week, with a total of 2,153 hospitalized patients on Wednesday. The state was among the first to start the reopening process…”Bob Greene: ‘Requiem for the Printing Press’ - WSJ: “This week the Miami Herald announced that it is officially moving out of its offices. Because of Covid-19, its reporters and editors have been working from home, and without a newsroom they’ll do that until at least the end of the year. … The loss has a powerful, bittersweet symbolism. As Brent Batten of Florida’s Naples Daily News, whose presses have been silenced and printing operations sent to Sarasota, about 100 miles away, put it: ‘We’re an office building attached to the most amazing piece of machinery any of us are ever likely to behold. Without it, we may as well be in a strip mall.’ It’s probably more important to keep a newspaper alive than to fret about where it’s printed. But in those buildings where, at deadline, there now is only stillness, and the floors don’t hum beneath the reporters’ feet, they know every night what it is they’re missing.”NO PAUSE FOR MCCONNELL IN JUDICIAL CONFIRMATIONSRoll Call: “A ghost from the old Senate that haunts the chamber’s judicial confirmation fights seems to be disappearing from the floor this year — and might be fading away for good. At about this time during presidential election years, senators have invoked the so-called Thurmond Rule, an unwritten agreement that calls for the chamber to stop approving circuit court nominations in the few months before Election Day. Named after the late South Carolina Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond, senators from both sides have used it to block action on a president’s appeals court picks. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, for instance, cited the rule on June 13, 2012, as reason to halt judicial nominations at the end of President Barack Obama’s first term. McConnell was minority leader at the time. But there’s nary a whisper of the Thurmond Rule this year. And thanks to Senate rule changes and McConnell’s focus on filling the courts with President Donald Trump’s nominees, the old rule looks like it will be ignored.”Ocasio-Cortez on defense ahead of primary - AP: “It’s Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s turn to defend her record and battle accusations that she’s lost touch with her district.

Luckily for him, he also had video evidence to prove it and a dad who found the whole episode pretty hilarious. Ido Kozikaro, an Israeli basketball player and contestant on TV show Survivor VIP, recently posted on Facebook a video showing a wild boar happily eating the contents of his son’s schoolbag to the delighted shrieks and exclamations of the boy and his friends. ‘When the kid comes back from school and says he doesn’t have any homework because a wild boar ate his bag and you don’t believe it and then… this,’ he posted on Facebook. In the video, Kozikaro’s son excitedly explains what is happening. ‘We ordered pizza and the wild boar ate all of our pizza and he also ate out of my bag, and he also ate the sweatshirt, and look, he also ate my bag,’ the schoolboy said. All this took part not in some remote, wooded enclave in Haifa, but rather in the very entrance to the boys’ school.”AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…","1632279361","1");
