"1","For the 34 percent of Detroit residents who do not have access to a car — many of whom are health care workers, grocery store workers, and other essential staff moving around the city by public transport — Duggan says the city will place 20,000 masks for public use on buses beginning this week. A drive-thru testing location has also been opened in Detroit. ","1574583904","11"
"2","When it comes to food and the coronavirus, the biggest threat is person-to-person contact in grocery stores. If you can, use contactless delivery and tip generously; if you need to go to a physical store, wear a mask and stay six feet away from other shoppers. Always make sure to wash your hands after returning from the store or unpacking your delivered goods. And remember: The impact of not being a jerk to the people in the long chain of how your food ends up in your kitchen is much more significant than the potential threat of you getting the coronavirus from a box of cereal.","1574694239","11"
"3","We can spend time on the theoretical risks, and that’s what we’re doing in trying to answer all these questions, but it’s still very much a theoretical kind of thing. Why don’t we focus on why there are high-risk individuals that are going to the grocery store without masks on? That’s a real, real issue.","1574694239","11"

"5","People of color might also have less ability to implement public health recommendations; as Krieger notes, despite a recent CDC recommendation to wear masks when in public, many people of color are justifiably afraid of wearing a mask into a store and being seen as a threat.

"6","“We have masks and social distancing,” Hutchinson told CNN. “And the people of Arkansas have embraced that.”","1576707908","11"
"7","It’s certainly possible that these steps will work — rigorous application of hand-washing, mask-wearing, school closures, and informal distancing could keep Arkansas safe, especially since few people are traveling these days. That said, the entire nation of Japan pursued this strategy, and while it seemed to be working for a while, it eventually led to a huge spike in cases. ","1576707908","11"
"8","Nobody likes to see price gouging during a crisis. But America has a shortage of critical medical supplies. And while it may be cheap to manufacture an N95 respirator mask once a factory is up and running, it costs quite a bit more to launch a whole new factory (or retool an existing one set up to make something else) than to recruit and train a new workforce. And people are especially unlikely to do that if they think excess demand is going to vanish in a year. ","1577038137","11"
"9","The federal government should identify a set of critical supplies — ventilators, respirator masks, face shields, disposable gloves, hand sanitizer, and hospital gowns seem like the big ones — and establish a large fund to offer zero-interest loans to finance retooling costs and to guarantee large purchases of these products at higher-than-normal prices. If this results in more supplies than needed, they could be given away to lower-income countries and stockpiled for future emergencies in the US. ","1577038137","11"
"10","As long as this pathogen is circulating in the background and we don’t have a vaccine and very effective therapeutics, this is going to alter the way we live and do business. Some of it is going to be subtle. You’ll see businesses advertising deep cleanings. People aren’t going to shake hands as much anymore. Wearing masks in public is going to become more fashionable in Western societies.","1577825238","11"
"11","I don’t know how much you can just create new manufacturing for some of these commodity products because the starting materials are the weak link in the supply chain. Even if you had extra manufacturing for, let’s say, N95 masks, the actual ingredient that goes into making those masks is manufactured outside the US — it would be hard to scale a new manufacturer for that. That’s what’s in shortage right now. ","1577825238","11"
"12","I think it’s going to be a gradual reintroduction of activity. You’ll probably lift the stay-at-home orders, but you’ll tell people to wear a mask if they go out for a period of time. You’ll allow certain businesses to go back to work, but you’ll tell businesses that they have to put certain restrictions in place to try to reduce the number of people who congregate together — basically maintain some social distancing in the workplace. You want to reduce human-to-human interaction as much as possible while having a functioning economy, allowing people to reengage in normal activity. ","1577825238","11"
"13","In unspoken hospital hierarchies, staff like Gourdine rank lower in the pecking order than doctors and advanced practice providers. They tend to receive safety information or personal protective equipment (PPE) like gowns, gloves, or masks later than providers do. Few expect to receive prioritized testing or expedited care should they require treatment. ","1578043911","11"
"14","Advocating for better protection has even gotten some staff punished. Thomas, the respiratory therapist, said that her “hospital has clamped down on the social media” and that posting pictures could “jeopardize [her] position at the hospital.” Jhonna Porter, a charge nurse at West Hills Hospital near Los Angeles, posted a Facebook plea for mask donations directly to the nurses’ association — not to the hospital administration. A few days later, she was suspended for an alleged violation of medical privacy laws. ","1578043911","11"
"15","West Hills Hospital disputed Porter’s interpretation. “The issue with Jhonna Porter arose when co-workers expressed concerns about her [sharing] specific information, including room numbers of possible COVID patients,” said West Hills Hospital in a statement. “Her later posts about masking and donations were not the issue.”","1578043911","11"
"16","Yet the country currently has the fourth-highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases and third-most deaths in the world. The country’s health care system is consistently ranked among the best in the world, yet France has experienced shortages of hospital beds, masks, and other critical products. As the number of confirmed cases and deaths continues to rise, popular food markets have been turned into makeshift morgues and high-speed trains have become Covid-19 patient transport vehicles. ","1578322433","11"
"17","“This moment, let’s be honest, has revealed cracks, shortages,” Macron said. “Like every country in the world, we have lacked gloves, hand gel, we haven’t been able to give out as many masks as we wanted to our health professionals.”","1578322433","11"
"18","The problem was compounded by a dearth of masks, leading the government to say only medical workers should wear them, not the general public. It turns out that, as France’s new Health Minister Olivier Véran (who took over in February after Buzyn abruptly resigned to run for mayor of Paris), told Parliament on March 19, France’s strategic supply of personal protective equipment wasn’t as robust as everyone had thought.","1578322433","11"
"19","“It was decided in 2011 and 2013 that there was no longer a need to keep massive stocks of masks, considering that factories could deliver quite quickly, namely in China,” Véran said, according to Politico.","1578322433","11"
"20","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for instance, didn’t tell the country to stop gathering in groups until March 15 — weeks after a top CDC official announced that the virus would begin spreading throughout the US. And after telling Americans for months that they should not wear masks unless they are sick, the government formally flipped that advice on April 3 and said that everyone should wear some kind of covering on their face in certain public settings.","1579248961","11"
"21","For instance: While President Trump has been correctly pilloried for describing the coronavirus as less dangerous than the flu, that message was commonplace in mainstream media outlets throughout February. And journalists — including my colleagues at Vox — were dutifully repeating exhortations from public health officials not to wear masks for much of 2020.","1579248961","11"
"22","At first, many, including the surgeon general of the US, told the public that masks weren’t necessary and that health care workers needed the scarce supplies. People were told they wouldn’t be able to properly fit them, although several studies suggest that even a homemade mask is better than no mask. Finally, in mid-March, both the CDC and the WHO recommended wearing masks if you are sick. ","1579248945","11"
"23","Today, the CDC is recommending everyone wear a mask when out in public, while the WHO is standing by its recommendation to only wear one if sick or caring for someone else who is sick. “There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit,” said Mike Ryan, the head of the WHO health emergencies team. Hong Kong health officials disagree; they have recommended everyone wear masks and say it has helped control the spread of Covid-19.","1579248945","11"
"24","Because this is a new virus, Gostin says, “Everyone has to operate in circumstances of scientific uncertainty. We have to do the best we can with the knowledge we have.” But new information is coming out every week about the virus’s transmissibility, including one notable report in early April that it can be aerosolized just by breathing and talking. (At this point, he, too, thinks widespread mask use is justified.) ","1579248945","11"
"25","For now, the best we have are educated opinions — no one yet has definitive data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates and mask-wearing. ","1579248945","11"
"26","I was used to being really busy, and it was nice to have some time to myself. I wrote, read, and did some painting, but I didn’t force myself to do anything. At night, I would go to my friend’s bar, which was closed to the public, and play games with him and a couple of other people. This was safe to do in Beijing because of the vast infrastructure that could be easily devoted solely to combating the spread of the virus. In order to ride public transport or enter certain public spaces, you have to wear a mask and not be running a fever. A security guard would usually take my temperature when I entered or left my residential compound or went to the store or got on the subway. ","1580012235","11"
"27","However, I’m now stranded in the US indefinitely because of visa issues. China has closed its borders temporarily to foreign nationals and I’m in the Bay Area. Since people here don’t usually wear a mask and there’s less enforcement of directives, I find that I’m much more worried about actually getting the virus here than I was in Beijing, although I don’t advocate this approach for the US at all. I stay inside much more, and unless I need to go to the consulate or to go on a walk, I try not to leave my friend’s house whom I’m staying with.","1580012235","11"
"28","I haven’t left my apartment in weeks. My husband goes grocery shopping once a week, wearing a mask, and waits in line for one hour, sometimes two. I have two small children. Luckily we have balconies, so we just go out on the balcony. But they haven’t been out of the house in weeks, either.","1580012235","11"
"29","In an ideal world, no one would need to wear a protective mask at all. In a less-than-ideal world, only health care workers would require them, and masks that meet all of the CDC requirements would be provided in great stacks, allowing doctors, nurses, and hospital staff to safely do their jobs. In a slightly worse but still aspirational world, medical-grade masks would be readily accessible to everyone, and no one would need to be making them at home — for themselves, for the people they love, for the essential workers keeping us all safe. ","1580150218","11"
"30","We are not currently living in any of these worlds. In the world we are living in, the rise of homemade masks tells a complicated but hopeful story.","1580150218","11"
"31","There has been a great deal of confusion about mask guidelines since the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic, but current direction from the CDC indicates that everyone should be wearing a facial covering in certain public settings. While homemade masks are not as protective as N95s nor surgical masks, evidence suggests they are better than going without, and even better than a simple bandana, and you can make your own, even if you don’t have a sewing machine. As a result, people around the world are making masks for themselves and others.","1580150218","11"
"32","Vox put out a call to see your masks and hear your stories about how they came to be. You sent us dozens of photos representing hundreds of masks, along with powerful stories of people trying to help their family, friends, neighbors, and strangers in this uncertain time. From military personnel who learned to sew for this very purpose, to long-time crafters who used their supplies to sew personal protective equipment for hospital staff, to friends who made masks without being asked, these stories paint a picture of people working together to keep one another safe.","1580150218","11"
"33","I used material already in my home to minimize risk, I’m a crafty person so I had loads to work with. I found a pattern that was washable, had a pocket for a filter or to cover a surgical mask, and could have wire over the nose.","1580150218","11"
"34","I’m making masks for friends and family. All I asked was for the postage and for them not to mind the crazy fabrics I used for their masks. I also made about 20 for my sister who is a nurse, and I’m averaging 10 masks a day while working from home full time at my job.","1580150218","11"
"35","My friend made the mask for me. Her and her sister have been making a lot of masks at home, and posted on Facebook that did they were willing to give them away to people. My friend dropped it off in my mailbox and she has the same one I do.","1580150218","11"
"36","This mask is made of a pair of baseball pants on the outside and a dress shirt on the inside. I miss baseball so much, so this is my homage to America’s pastime. ","1580150218","11"
"37","This mask has a removable HEPA filter in between. I went with around-the-head elastic to avoid the over-ears style. I also sewed masks for my daughter and other family members. ","1580150218","11"
"38","I have since made over 117 masks and counting. I supplied them to my entire medical unit, some units who asked for help in another state, and working on my neighborhood and anyone with at-risk family members. ","1580150218","11"
"39","I’m a crafter so I used fabric, pipe cleaners, and elastics that I already had at home and I made it using my sewing machine. I used patterns that I found on a Vox article and YouTube tutorials from doctors and nurses. I made an inside pocket in each mask to add a filter but I have tried different patterns since not all fit the same. Especially with kids, it’s a learning process.","1580150218","11"
"40","At the University of Southern California, School of Dramatic Arts, most of the production staff (props, costumes, scenery) have been sewing cloth masks since March 16 for the USC Hospital system. Here I am modeling one! So far we’ve delivered over 400.","1580150218","11"
"41","My husband is an emergency doctor. I scavenged some of his old scrubs to make pleated masks, following a pattern I found online and modified to include a filter pocket. The scrubs material isn’t very thick, so these require a filter (blue shop towels) to be of any use, but they are comfortable and breathable and look sort of official because they’re scrub green. ","1580150218","11"
"42","I am not crafty, and I can barely use my sewing machine (see photo of crooked mask). But sewing these goddamn things has become my rage (i.e., at the state of the world) displacement activity, and I can’t stop making them now. I experiment with different designs. I sew a few every day and have started sending them to friends and family members. I rarely leave the house, so it’s not like I need all of these. ","1580150218","11"
"43","I’m afraid to wear it in public because I worry that being masked will make me (even more likely to become) a hate crime target. The couple of times I’ve worn one out, despite the current guidance, no one else was wearing one. My reluctance to be seen in one means sewing all of these masks makes even less sense. ","1580150218","11"
"44","I’ve currently made 30 masks, and I’m working on another batch right now. It started as just for my family, then my mom’s friends wanted some, and now I’m mailing them to the Houston Food Bank. It’s already a big transition from traditional school to online school, and the addition of making masks is tough to balance. As a senior in high school, I needed something I could control, after my entire year was stripped away. ","1580150218","11"
"45","I took donations. I didn’t want to charge, I know a lot of people lost even more income than I did/will be. I’m so glad I did it, even though it was a crazy week. [People I’ve made masks for] sent me pictures, and I’ve been able to share them with my son. I got to connect with very old friends and contribute from a distance.","1580150218","11"
"46","I was lucky to have funky fabric on hand, so each mask had a little style, but I’ll admit it made me sad to sew to mini masks for my nephew and a coworkers daughter. My heart broke a little that kiddos will remember this and have to learn to protect themselves all the more. ","1580150218","11"
"47","I work at a hospital and supplies are in demand. As interpreters, we’ve been removed from the “front lines” and are working remotely. If my using a homemade mask means our nurses have more on hand, I’m happy to.","1580150218","11"
"48","Gov. Andrew Cuomo has issued a new executive order that requires wearing face coverings in public. It will go into effect on Friday. The governor said that masks, bandanas, or scarves should be worn on public transit and anytime people are at risk of coming within less than six feet of each other. Cuomo said the rule could be enforced with civil penalties. (Cuomo, on Thursday, also extended New York’s coronavirus restrictions until at least May 15.)","1580268637","11"
"49","“Stopping the spread is everything,” Cuomo said during his daily briefing in Albany on Wednesday. “How can you not wear a mask when you’re going to come close to a person?”","1580268637","11"
"50","New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had already urged city residents to wear face coverings in public, and other states have taken similar steps. In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy has required the use of face coverings in stores and on transit. Gov. Larry Hogan in Maryland has issued similar guidelines. Earlier this month, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis gave a press conference encouraging the public to wear cloth masks, and modeled one himself.","1580268637","11"
"51","All officials are clear on one thing, though: Medical-grade masks need to be saved for the health care and essential workers on the frontlines. If you need a mask and don’t know where to get one, Vox’s Alanna Okun has a great explainer on how to make your own.","1580268637","11"
"52","Germany is slowly loosening up its lockdown coronavirus lockdown restrictions, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Wednesday. The country is taking a gradual approach. Some of its shops will begin to open next week, though people must still keep their distance and Merkel is encouraging people to wear masks in public. The country also plans to reopen some schools May 4, though it will likely include mitigation strategies like smaller class sizes. ","1580268637","11"
"53","A fake Covid-19 testing kit is more dangerous than a fake Chanel bag. A counterfeit test could lead someone to believe they’re negative when they’ve been infected. A fake cure could leave someone worse off than before, and possibly dead. Even a phony N95 mask might mislead a doctor into believing they’re protected in a hospital full of Covid-19 patients, where faulty equipment can lead to more spreading of the virus. ","1581209639","11"
"54","Coronavirus-related scams aren’t limited to tests or treatments. As broken supply chains lead to shortages, instances of price-gouging and outright fraud regarding medical supplies are becoming increasingly worrisome. In late March, a health care workers union claimed to secure a stash of 39 million N95 masks to sell to hospitals, a huge claim at the time that many found dubious. The masks never ended up being delivered to some health care centers, and an attempted seizure by federal authorities revealed that they were part of an elaborate, international grift. ","1581209639","11"
"55","The forehead thermometers will remain as a secondary check for workers flagged by the thermal cameras; some workers quoted by Dastin and Hu reported feeling unsafe about performing the thermometer checks, with one saying, “a line once formed outside her warehouse, and employees could not receive masks until after they had entered the building and had their temperatures taken,” raising social distancing concerns.","1582166799","11"
"56","Amazon has raised warehouse pay and pushed new sanitation efforts like “staggered break times to promote social distancing,” forehead thermometers, mask distribution, and now, the thermal cameras — but it has resisted demands for fulfillment center shutdowns and paid leave for all (not just those with symptoms). In one case it even reopened a distribution center just one day after a worker tested positive.","1582166799","11"
"57","The United States government has ordered 20 million N95 masks for health care workers through a set of suppliers that are overwhelmingly unproven and untested, according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal.","1582277448","11"
"58","At least 80 percent of the masks, which are due to be delivered by the end of May, are being ordered from vendors which either haven’t done business with the government before or haven’t previously provided medical equipment specifically to the government. The government’s heavy reliance on untested suppliers of medical equipment raises questions about the quality of the masks, and whether they will be delivered in a timely fashion.","1582277448","11"
"59","The masks are being purchased for about $6 each through the $110 million contract — a price that is more expensive than the typical price of an N95 mask before the pandemic began, but is roughly in line with current market rates. ","1582277448","11"
"60","The fact that the government is counting on untested suppliers for a crucial piece of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care providers is a worrying prospect at a time when there are widespread shortages of masks, gowns, gloves and other critical equipment for health care providers dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.  ","1582277448","11"
"61","N95 masks are more complex — and more complicated to make — than a surgical mask. As Recode’s Rebecca Heilweil explains, certified N95 masks are “special”:","1582277448","11"
"62","Unlike a conventional surgical mask, N95 masks are built so that 95 percent of very small airborne particles can’t get through. These masks also need to be approved by the CDC’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and, depending on the type, the Food and Drug Administration. In order to fulfill those requirements, N95 masks must be constructed so that they seal tightly around one’s mouth and nose, unlike surgical or cloth masks which are loose-fitting. ... The masks themselves are difficult to make, in part because they require specialized equipment to meet stringent regulatory standards. ","1582277448","11"
"63","The federal government has placed separate PPE orders from traditional suppliers as well — including orders for 600 million N95 masks from huge, prominent vendors like 3M and Honeywell International Inc, according to the Journal. But those orders extend through next year, and those vendors also supply masks to many other clients. ","1582277448","11"
"64","When the government makes rushed contracts with less well-known vendors they also may be more likely to be susceptible to attempted fraud. The Justice Department recently disrupted a foreign criminal scheme in which two people or organizations attempted to fraudulently sell nearly 40 million N95 masks to health care providers in the US. ","1582277448","11"
"65","Unless or until scientists have data to back it up, though, the impact of social distancing is as much hypothesis and intuition as scientific fact. Luckily, a new study out of Hong Kong indicates that the precautious taken there — similar to those taken in the US, like closed schools, travel restrictions, mask-wearing, and general distancing — have had a measurable effect on the spread of Covid-19 and the flu. That should give people confidence that social distancing is working, even with its painful economic toll.","1583892585","11"
"66","In addition, the public has responded by changing their behavior. According to this new study, led by researchers from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control in Hong Kong, most people say they are avoiding crowded places (85 percent in March) and staying home as much as possible (75 percent). People are practicing better hygiene, too: The percentage who said they wear masks jumped from 75 percent in January to 99 percent in March, and the percentage who say they wash their hands more than usual leaped from 71 percent to 95 percent. ","1583892585","11"
"67","President Trump’s federal social distancing guidelines are in effect until the end of April, but some states are aiming for more accelerated timelines. In Georgia, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has said gyms, hair and nail salons, and bowling alleys can open by Friday if they follow social distancing rules, screen workers for fevers, and enforce mask-wearing. Starting next Monday, April 27, movie theaters will be allowed to reopen, and restaurants in the state will be allowed to resume limited dine-in service. Bars and nightclubs, however, will remain closed.","1584926841","11"
"68","In the United States, masks are more readily associated with crime than public health. We’re a nation of mask skeptics: Several states have enacted anti-mask laws throughout history as a means of quelling protest and stifling dissent. But the immediacy of the pandemic — the horror stories of bodies stacked up in refrigerated trucks, the overwhelmed hospitals, and the atmosphere of fear and paranoia created in its wake — will force Westerners to reconsider old stigmas associated with masks for the sake of public health. ","1585639308","11"
"69","The mask aversion is compounded by the longstanding epidemic of police violence against people of color, some of whom understandably fear the consequences of purchasing essential goods while cloaked in a prophylactic bandana. Even now, it’s easy for a mask to evoke dastardly connotations or be mistaken for a disguise. ","1585639308","11"
"70","“Wearing a mask may be even stranger to us than wearing a Speedo at the beach,” says Brandon Brown, an epidemiologist and associate professor at UC Riverside. “It’s just not the norm [in the US], so there is judgment, but there is nothing wrong with it.” ","1585639308","11"
"71","In China and other nations, masks are now part of everyday life, Abrar Chughtai, an epidemiologist and researcher at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, says via email. “Asian countries have faced such epidemics and pandemics more in the past,” he says, including SARS outbreak of 2002-2004, which still looms large in the public imagination in China and Hong Kong. ","1585639308","11"
"72","These nations have long understood face coverings as a public health resource and a tool for cultivating national unity. It’s routine, for example, to see people donning masks on the streets of Beijing, Seoul, or Taipei as they take to the streets or socialize with friends, because someone with a cough will likely be hesitant to put their neighbors in jeopardy. ","1585639308","11"
"73","But public sentiment on the issue of masks is evolving. Just as the US mobilizes to provide front-line workers with personal protective equipment amid mass shortages, brands are also swooping in to meet a surge in demand for masks that gel with modern consumer tastes. Cloth masks designed and marketed by Los Angeles Apparel and Christian Siriano are reflections of this broader shift in the cultural climate. Mega-influencers like Kim Kardashian and Bella Hadid have also endorsed them with pandemic-era selfies, lending masks a stamp of pop-culture-approved normalcy. ","1585639308","11"
"74","Though the science behind the effectiveness of masks is far from exact, living through the pandemic will undeniably alter Western attitudes about them, as well as government policy. And as the memory of Covid-19 becomes permanently enmeshed with the national psyche, masks are likely to become a fixture of our post-pandemic world.","1585639308","11"
"75","The images of Wisconsin’s recent election — the first in-person election held during the height of the Covid-19 US outbreak — were dystopian. In Milwaukee, where the number of available polling places shrank from 180 to just five for a city of about 592,000 people, voters wearing surgical masks stood 6 feet apart in lines stretching around the block. One woman held up a large homemade sign emblazoned with the words “This is ridiculous.” ","1585639308","11"
"76","Working through grief is an isolating process, but it’s somehow even lonelier with my world shrunk to a 500-square-foot apartment. It’s in my nature to ask for some space, but now all I have is space. There were traditional observances we missed out on, but I was robbed of the comforting rituals, too: going through boxes of my grandfather’s old photos, yelling to my sisters in the other room for waterproof mascara, having a “take your mind off it” dinner with friends where everything felt normal again for one night. Instead of finding solace through support and human connection, I “went” back to work the next day and tried to live with the loss. I got burned out from answering sympathetic text messages. I took a government-approved solitary walk and cried openly on the sidewalk, my face mask drawing a curtain around me. It was all so anticlimactic that some days I forget he’s even gone.","1585639275","11"
"77","On a recent Friday night in Hong Kong, two police vans idled outside an upscale Italian restaurant on Wyndham Street. Only a few months earlier, their presence might have been an ominous sign that a unit of anti-protest riot cops was in the area, tear gas and pepper spray at the ready. But as is the case for much of daily life here since January, Hong Kong has moved from a state of protest to pandemic, and that night, instead of an armed “raptor” force wearing dark green fatigues and gas masks, the vans discharged a group of what looked like ordinary patrolmen in simple short-sleeve uniforms and surgical masks.

"79","And so, with the number of newly reported COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong staying firmly in single digits over the preceding few days, I traded house socks for chukka boots, slipped on a surgical mask, and did what many in the U.S. have been longing to do for weeks. I went out for dinner.","1585815543","11"
"80","Having an infrared thermometer pointed at your forehead in a non-medical setting might kill the mood in America, but in Hong Kong it blends in relatively naturally with the rest of the ways the city has become visibly anti-contagion since the SARS outbreak more than 16 years ago. Signs in elevators remind riders how often the buttons are sterilized. Hand sanitizer has been a lobby staple for years. And then there are the masks. ","1585815543","11"
"81","Well before COVID-19, it would’ve been hard to go a day in Hong Kong and not see someone wearing a mask. They’re common enough that if you met a friend on the street and someone asked you later if the friend had worn one, you might not remember. In restaurants, I’d seen staff wearing masks from time to time too, though almost never in more upscale situations. But at Frank’s — as with every other restaurant I checked in on — all staff wore the same thin, blue surgical masks Hong Kongers had been wearing on the street for years.","1585815543","11"
"82","While Hong Kong’s pre-existing mask culture somewhat prepared me, in the U.S., it might have felt a little like a mass text had gone out on Halloween, where the in-joke was that instead of asking everyone to dress in a sexy costume, every costume would be a surgeon: Surgeon servers. Surgeon cooks. A surgeon DJ. Even having lived with regular mask culture for years now — and among their near-ubiquity for weeks — seeing every single person who handled my food and drink wear the tell-tale sign of medical caution was jarring. ","1585815543","11"
"83","Still, not long into the meal, as the unnerving feeling began to subside, it was quickly replaced by communication issues. I’ve heard a lot of people lament the non-verbal communication lost behind masks, the missed smiles or bitten lips, but more difficult for me were the few times I couldn’t understand what my server was trying to ask me. He was enunciating clearly at a volume well above the ambient noise, but without seeing half his face, he may as well have held his hand behind his back and asked me, “How many fingers?” “Sure,” I replied the first time this happened, and the result was a side of squash I didn’t think I’d ordered. (It was great.)","1585815543","11"
"84","After dinner, I picked my own mask up off my knee, where it had remained throughout the meal, and headed downstairs for a cocktail. I ordered at the bar, got my drink at the bar, and then immediately had to walk away from the bar and stand against the far wall. The bar itself had no stools, and featured printouts explaining that customers could not hang out at the bar. In a total reverse of the usual crush to buy drinks, the few guests in the quarter-full room were clustered in small groups against the far wall with me. Only they weren’t with me at all. ","1585815543","11"
"85","Outside, I walked back past the cops and did a quick loop through an eerily empty Lan Kwai Fong, before wandering back up towards Soho to see how restaurants were doing there. Turning up Peel Street, I was only half-surprised to see several large gaggles of maskless expats drinking out in front of restaurants on the dead-end road. You know that particular genre of sports bloopers where an athlete begins celebrating right on the verge of winning, only to have victory snatched away by someone actually digging for those last few inches? I’ve gotten some good schadenfreude out of those scenes, but with only one new case of COVID reported in Hong Kong the day before my night out, these people felt like the last link on our whole city’s relay team, and their confidence made me nervous. ","1585815543","11"
"86","Steam rose in the open kitchen, swirling past a flurry of masked chefs shuffling around their stations. What felt like more servers than I can ever remember seeing on that floor swarmed about the dining room. And everywhere there were people eating. Everywhere, except of course within about six feet on all sides of me. If my distant neighbors and I had shared a brief conversation before I finished my drink, decided there was no point in trying to stay out anymore, and headed home, it most likely would’ve consisted of an exaggerated wave and a pantomimed shout, as if we each occupied either side of an enormous cavern, and could never get much closer than we were already. It would’ve been mildly funny. And mostly true.","1585815543","11"
"87","Amid a nationwide shortage of tests and personal protective equipment such as masks and respirators, some have used their privilege to their advantage — and flaunted the results on social media. As health care workers across the country resort to using ski goggles as eye shields and average Americans apply DIY mask patterns to old T-shirts, models like Bella Hadid and Naomi Campbell are posting photos in protective equipment that’s nearly impossible to procure.","1585904246","11"
"88","Others, such as Kris Jenner, the matriarch of the Kardashian empire, have been tested for the coronavirus even without showing symptoms, while in other parts of Los Angeles, officials refused tests to people whose loved ones had died of Covid-19. Some fans are unfazed (“You are still freaking beautiful with a mask on,” someone posted on Gwyneth Paltrow’s selfie in a device that looked even more complex than the coveted N95), but comments sections reveal growing frustration. “[Y]ou better be donating any of the extra masks you have to nurses,” one commenter wrote on actress Kate Hudson’s photo in a surgical cover.","1585904246","11"
"89","In the first crucial weeks of the coronavirus spreading in the United States, Americans were instructed to wear a face mask only if they were sick. In the absence of widespread testing, that most likely meant you’d wear a face mask if you felt the symptoms of Covid-19. ","1585904242","11"
"90","That’s why face masks are important for both sick and presumably healthy people, say public health experts Shan Soe-Lin and Robert Hecht. In early April, the US Centers for Disease control reversed their recommendations on face mask use and now advise that Americans should wear homemade cloth masks regardless of whether they are sick or symptomatic. ","1585904242","11"
"91","The inconsistency in recommendations led to a lot of confusion about whether face masks work. They do work, but they shouldn’t be thought of as a panacea in the fight against Covid-19, Soe-Lin and Hecht said. Instead, they should be employed along with social distancing and hand-washing as a three-pronged effort to stay healthy. ","1585904242","11"
"92","The senators wrote with urgency, spurred by recent reports from black men who say they were racially profiled for wearing protective face masks, a measure the CDC recommends to prevent Covid-19. ","1586006263","11"
"93","In a video that went viral earlier this month, an officer in Miami stepped out of his squad car to arrest a black man with a face mask moving items near a van filled with equipment. It took the unmasked officer just over 60 seconds to put the man in handcuffs and detain him. It’s now known that the man, Armen Henderson, was a doctor who has volunteered to test homeless people for Covid-19.  ","1586006263","11"
"94","In Wood River, Illinois, last month, two black men wearing surgical masks recorded themselves being trailed by a cop, who was occasionally gripping his gun, in a Walmart store. One of the men said that when the officer approached them, he wrongly told them that there was a national and state order banning the wearing of face masks. The local police department has opened an investigation into the incident and told the Washington Post that the officer followed the men because he believed they were “acting suspiciously.” In the video, the men expressed dismay: “We’re being asked to leave for being safe.” ","1586006263","11"
"95","Now, one of the few practices that could potentially save more black lives — wearing masks — could create the opposite effect. In early April, when the CDC first recommended that all Americans wear face coverings in public, black men were quick to express hesitation: wearing face coverings would intensify racist perceptions of criminality, especially to police. In essence, black men have to pick their poison — risk their lives (and the lives of others) to Covid-19 by not wearing a mask, risk their lives to police officers who see them as suspicious while wearing a mask, or some tragic amalgamation of both.","1586006263","11"
"96","Stop-and-frisk is just one of many reasons why black people have come to distrust law enforcement. In a pandemic, fears of being profiled and stopped may force them to forgo key safeguards like wearing a facemask or calling on police for help. Plus, wearing a face mask may lead to more stress that comes with being a perpetual victim of racism. In turn, stress exacerbates the aforesaid Covid-19 risk factors; then comes death.","1586006263","11"
"97","In the case of traffic stops, Flowers points to a Stanford University study of data from 2015 that found that blacks are more likely to be pulled over and searched for illegal substances than white Americans. This is because of implicit bias, Flowers says, not because black drivers are more likely to be carrying illegal substances. “Now add people wearing masks. My experience, rooted in empirical evidence, suggests that bad decisions by law enforcement due to implicit and even explicit bias will only get worse [during the pandemic].”","1586006263","11"
"98","Greater transparency is a step on the way to culture change. Similar to the recent national push for Covid-19 data disaggregated by race and ethnicity, there must be a push for regular information about coronavirus-related arrests by race and other markers like socioeconomic status. Mauer says we must question how police agencies might be defining crime differently right now. For example, if someone is arrested while wearing a mask, or for not wearing a mask, we must first understand how police departments are identifying this as a crime. ","1586006263","11"
"99","(The early evidence that seemingly healthy people can still infect others with the coronavirus is one of the main reasons behind the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendation that everyone wear a mask in public: so that people who don’t know they have the virus don’t accidentally infect others with it.) ","1586025051","11"
"100","In the meantime, all of these mounting data support continued social distancing practices, mask-wearing, and other preventative measures for everyone — no matter how healthy they feel.","1586025051","11"
"101","For Helen Sweeney, a veterinarian in upstate New York, being essential right now means curbside service where pets, not people, are allowed into her clinic. Her team tries to take videos and pictures so the influx of new pet owners have a sense that they “were there,” or find ways for them to peek through a window. For euthanasia, though, they break their own rules — owners are allowed in as long as everyone wears masks and gloves and stays at a safe distance.","1587024097","11"
"102","One social worker in Queens told me she thinks one-third of her department is out sick, largely due to Covid-19. The day before we spoke, a nursing manager had snuck her downstairs and disguised her as a nurse so she could get a highly coveted N95 mask. She’s struggling to find child care for her kids — it’s especially impossible to find a babysitter for your kids when you work in a hospital.","1587024097","11"
"103","When people flooded grocery stores and retailers to stock up as the coronavirus pandemic set in in March, essential workers were the ones who had to deal with them — and were among those most at risk for contracting the disease from the crowds. They’re the ones who have to interact with customers complaining about out-of-stock items or compel them to abide by guidelines around social distancing and masks. They also don’t need to hear about whatever people’s quarantine hobbies are on social media — they can see it in buying trends.","1587024097","11"
"104","Those who work in retail stores are competing with customers for some of the items that are in such high demand, and if they’re lucky, their managers stow away a box of hand sanitizer or Lysol wipes every once in a while so they can take them home. The personal protective equipment they usually need for their jobs is suddenly in short supply. Obviously, doctors and nurses need them more, but you don’t want to be serving food without gloves or working construction without a mask.","1587024097","11"
"105","To be clear: Tourism to Florida to play on the beach is utterly unacceptable right now. If you live far enough away that you’d have to make an extended trip, you should stay home and use outdoor spaces closer to where you live. You should stay away from people and wear a mask when you go out. And personally, I would still stay home as much as you possibly can. But there’s a case to be made that Florida’s reasonable, limited actions here are being condemned out of proportion.","1587141971","11"
"106","In it, a girl with a dangerous ability explores a cavernous underground world without exit routes, filled with people wearing masks. The more she learns about her mysterious surroundings, the more she realizes that it may be up to her to wake up an entire civilization — for, as one character warns her, “It is dangerous to lock oneself away and lose track of what is happening outside.”","1587999905","11"
"107","A Face Like Glass is set within an underground society, Caverna, whose inhabitants are skilled artisans but who all lack the ability to display their emotions. To compensate, they depend upon the talents of Facesmiths, mask-makers who create highly ornate masks that display a wide range of human expressions. ","1587999905","11"
"108","In such a society, the ability to own numerous masks to display a range of emotions is a luxury shared by the privileged few. Meanwhile, the rest of the populace is known as “drudges,” members of a destitute and downtrodden workforce who can only afford one or two masks — meaning they can only display a very small range of expressions at all times. That makes communicating how they truly feel not only difficult but also dangerous.","1587999905","11"
"109","Into this odd society tumbles the human Neverfell, wearing the unthinkable: a naturally animated face that reveals her every emotion. Worried her mask-less face could put her in danger, a master craftsman named Grandible takes her in and makes her his apprentice, keeping her away from the rest of Caverna. Neverfell grows up sequestered for most of her young life, with no memory of her life before Caverna, understanding only that her face is somehow different from everyone else’s — a terrible abomination. ","1587999905","11"
"110","To hide it, Grandible gives her a mask of her own. But he can’t keep her hidden away forever, and when she finally finds her way out of his caves and into the rest of Caverna (by following a white rabbit, no less), she topples a complicated, intricate series of dominos. Desperate to figure out who she is, Neverfell finds herself embroiled in political schemes, murderous plots, and a populist uprising, as she becomes the unwitting “face” of the outside world to a people who’ve nearly forgotten the outside world exists.","1587999905","11"

"112","The national numbers also mask massive variation between the states. Rhode Island has tested 39 people per 1,000, and New York, the state hardest hit by the pandemic, has tested about 34 per 1,000 — while Kansas, Virginia, Texas, and Arizona have all reported testing rates below 8 per 1,000.","1588061926","11"

"131","White House aides recently told the New York Times that Pence doesn’t feel like he has to wear a mask in public because he is regularly tested for the coronavirus. But that argument is flawed for a variety of reasons, including that coronavirus tests are occasionally inaccurate and Pence could contract (and spread) the virus between tests. By refusing to wear one at the Mayo Clinic, he could have unwittingly spread the virus to patients and workers there; and should he have become infected with the virus, he could be a source of community spread at the White House.","1591613684","11"

"148","My downstairs neighbor who is 5 will sit on the porch with us and when somebody walks by, he’ll yell, “Social distancing!” When children are playing and they’re acting out certain coronavirus situations, like putting masks on toys or making things social distance, that’s really, really normal. Children use play as a way to work out what’s currently going on in their lives emotionally and cognitively.  ","1594486272","11"
"149","When you see your child engaging in some form of play, that’s a wonderful opportunity to ask them open-ended questions like, “What’s going on? Why are your toys spread out?” That way, you can understand how your child is grappling with the situation and that’s an opportunity for you to maybe have some teachable moments. Anything that we do as adults, when we normalize it and model that behavior, children pick up on it. It can be as simple as washing our hands more or putting on a mask. That just becomes the new thing for them.","1594486272","11"
"150","If a child asks, “Are people dying?” Say yes. Don’t lie, but remember to tell them that not everybody dies. Add that positive into the conversation. You can explain how we can social distance to keep our families safe or wear a mask and wash our hands more. As a parent, you can boil down the big scary thing and make it super clear and tangible as to what we can do. Children need to feel empowered; the lack of information and lack of power are two things that really trigger fear with our children. If we can solve those issues, we can help them feel empowered even in this situation.","1594486272","11"
"151","If that means making masks, putting things up on windows, calling relatives, these are ways to make sure that your child can feel that they’re safe. All these things are beneficial during this time. One thing to keep in mind is that children are extraordinarily concrete creatures. Abstract ideas are not their forte. Anything you can do to make it relatable to their life is helpful. ","1594486272","11"
"152","The fact that there were things I’ve been thinking of personally — to see them show up in search is always interesting. Like we have a 3D printer, and I was thinking, I wonder if other people search for how to 3D print face masks to donate to hospitals, which is a very specific thing. Searches for 3D printing are higher than ever before in history. And there’s some things which are kind of reassuring, like searches for how to help, food donation, helping the community, how to volunteer — all of those things are higher than ever before.

"156","The answer is, you probably don’t need to freak out about it. As long as you’re maintaining at least 6 feet of distance from other people and you’re not in a high-risk group, you’re engaged in a very low-risk activity, particularly if you and others are wearing masks.","1597911656","11"

You can see why, if you’re standing outdoors several feet away from an infected person, the virus might have a hard time making its way over to you at a high enough dose to actually infect you.  ","1597911656","11"
"158","Obviously, you don’t want to walk through someone’s fresh sneeze or cough cloud, and if this accidentally happens you should go home, change, and shower. But if you’re worrying about how many particles a passerby is generating with their exhalations, it may help to know that a study managed to quantify how many virus particles were detectable after patients who had Covid-19 and who were not wearing masks coughed five times into a petri dish at a distance of roughly 8 inches. ","1597911656","11"
"159","None of this is to say you should be cavalier when you venture into the outside world. Washing your hands, avoiding touching your face, being diligent about physical distancing, wearing masks in public, and disinfecting communal surfaces — all these things likely reduce transmission risk, and we should keep doing them, Rasmussen said. But she also said she feels fine about taking a walk with her husband outdoors. ","1597911656","11"
"160","Psychologically, different people have different levels of tolerance for risk. For some people, any risk that can be minimized, should be, no matter how small. For others, the recommended 6-foot distance, with masks, and the known decay of both the amount and the infectiousness of the virus — that’s good enough. ","1597911656","11"

"163","Poll workers wore face protection, masks, and medical gloves. Upon arrival at the polling station, voters’ temperatures were taken, and anyone showing signs of fever was taken to a more secluded area of the building to cast their ballots. Separate polling stations were set up outside of hospitals for people infected with Covid-19 to vote.","1598036858","11"
"164","With little time to prepare, poll workers scrambled to do whatever they could to minimize the risk of the virus spreading. Photos showed voters — many wearing masks, but some not — trying to maintain social distancing guidelines (remaining at least 6 feet apart) as best they could while standing in long lines waiting to vote, before being ushered into cramped schools, gyms, public libraries, and churches to cast their ballots. ","1598036858","11"
"165","Once they checked I had a mask on (I had brought one from home), they took my temperature to ensure that I showed no fever; those who had a temperature above 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 degrees Fahrenheit) were escorted to a separate polling booth in a secluded area before being sent for virus testing. They then squeezed hand sanitizer into my palms and gave me gloves to cover my clean hands. ","1598036858","11"
"166","The only time I took off my mask was when an official compared my face with my photo ID, which was required in the South Korean elections, and the entire process only lasted about 10 seconds. ","1598036858","11"

"173","It’s not just Walmart, either. As of April 1, employees at Office Depot, Walgreens, and Target were being discouraged from wearing masks, sometimes because of concerns that customers might find them “unsettling,” according to the New York Times. In March, a coalition representing Trader Joe’s workers said the employees were not being allowed to wear gloves. In early April, employees at MOM’s Organic Market in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, staged a protest demanding that the store limit customers and take other steps to keep them safe.","1598092297","11"
"174","Meanwhile, Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said on April 22 that the chain would begin requiring workers at all its stores to wear masks.

"175","Some parts of the country are responding to the problem more quickly than the federal government. On April 15, for example, California’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health issued new guidance for grocery stores, including limiting the number of customers and providing masks if the proper distance cannot be maintained. Those guidelines can be a model for the rest of the country, Logan said, but they have to be enforced. “These things have very limited value without having a proper system of enforcement,” he said.","1598092297","11"
"176","The interview took place during Trump’s at times surreal, mask-less trip to a Honeywell plant in Phoenix, Arizona, where masks are produced.

"183","Korea, which simply had too many cases to isolate this aggressively, needed to adopt a tiered system. Moderately ill people are sent to an isolation center, and only genuinely asymptomatic cases are told to stay home and self-quarantine there. But people ordered to stay home aren’t left on their own. The government sends “quarantine care packages” with groceries, masks, hand sanitizer, and instructions on how to safely dispose of potentially contaminated trash. The Koreans have also been experimenting with location-tracking bracelets to enforce self-quarantine orders. ","1599769537","11"
"184","Still, the studies on heat, light, and humidity, plus the fact coronavirus has a harder time spreading in open-air areas, suggest that the outdoors may be a safe target for a slow reopening as transmission of the virus slows, as long as precautions like physical distancing and mask-wearing are followed. So outdoor activities could offer a respite to lockdowns and quarantines — one that’s also, potentially, good for physical and mental health.","1599773184","11"
"185","Weather could help determine how safe it is to go outside, even as social distancing continues. Some states, for example, are considering opening parks and beaches during the earlier phases of reopening their economies. Experts warn that summer weather won’t allow large gatherings — 50 people or more is often cited as way too many — but it could give people some assurance that they can go outdoors as long as they keep 6 feet or more of distance from others they don’t live with, avoid touching surfaces and their faces, and wear masks.","1599773184","11"
"186","Unlike many Americans who are worried about contracting or spreading the coronavirus, President Donald Trump has yet to be seen in public wearing a mask. He even went without one during his visit on Tuesday to a Honeywell facility in Arizona that otherwise requires them. The White House’s (flawed) rationale for this is that Trump doesn’t have to because he and everyone he comes into contact with is tested for the virus.","1600113258","11"

"190","The report examines how essential food, grocery, retail, and delivery workers are being protected by their employers. Researchers surveyed 8,000 workers from nearly 50 big service-sector companies such as Walmart, McDonald’s, Costco, Amazon, UPS, and Walgreens between March 7 and April 9 to find out what sort of health and safety measures are being taken in their workplaces. They asked them whether cleaning has increased, whether they’re being provided gloves and masks, and whether they’re being required to wear them.","1600215390","11"
"191","About two-thirds of employees said cleaning in their workplaces had improved, but in terms of providing protective equipment such as masks and gloves, companies have a long way to go.","1600215390","11"
"192","Overall, 65 percent of workers surveyed said their workplaces had started requiring additional cleaning, 56 percent said gloves had been made available, and only 19 percent said masks had been made available. Just because equipment is available doesn’t mean it is required: Just 18 percent of workers said they were required to wear gloves and only 7 percent were required to wear masks.","1600215390","11"
"193","“Among big-box stores and warehouse and fulfillment centers, Costco and Home Depot stand out and Walmart, Amazon, and UPS lag in terms of cleaning, gloves, and masks,” the report reads. “In grocery, larger shares of workers at Aldi report cleaning, gloves, and masks, while workers at Publix and Safeway report the fewest new protective measures. In pharmacy, CVS workers report less new cleaning, but more access to and requirements to use PPE.”","1600215390","11"

Now, we are allowed to wear gloves, but last I heard, we can only wear masks after hours. We are out of hand sanitizer and low on gloves.

Like every other essential business in the country, Ryan says Target employees feel underwater and out of the loop. When I first interviewed him on April 8, Ryan said he’d been promised plexiglass sneeze guards and protective masks, neither of which had materialized. When I checked back with Ryan on April 21, he said the protective gear did finally arrive the week before.

"211","His pitch: Provide the funds needed to dust off four dormant manufacturing lines, and his firm would produce 1.7 million N95 masks every week. According to Bowen, he’d been raising the alarm for years that the US was too dependent on foreign countries (where nearly 90 percent of masks used in the country come from) for production, and argued his manufacturing lines offered both a way around that, and to ensure the US would have the masks it needed. ","1602940886","11"
"212","Rick Bright — the former director of HHS’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (who was ousted in April, and later filed a whistleblower complaint alleging he was demoted for fighting for science-based preparations “over political expediency”) — pushed top HHS officials to accept Bowen’s offer, to no avail. Prestige Ameritech later exported a million masks to China. ","1602940886","11"
"213","“This was in sharp contrast to groups like the National Council of Textile Organizations and companies like Honeywell and Parkdale Mills, which have helped America very rapidly build up cost effective domestic mask capacity measuring in the hundreds of millions,” Navarro told the Post. ","1602940886","11"
"214","The federal government went on to spend more than $600 million on contracts including mask production. Honeywell and 3M were given contracts worth more than $170 million to produce protective gear. And a tactical training company with no history of producing medical equipment was given $55 million to make N95 masks for $5.50 each — a price around seven to nine times greater than other suppliers, including Bowen’s company. Prestige Ameritech was eventually given a $9.5 million contract in early April to produce N95 masks for 79 cents each. ","1602940886","11"

","1602940886","11"
"217","The problem is about both supply and demand. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, China made half the world’s face masks. When the outbreak took off there, China started to use its supply and hoard what remained. This problem has only spread since, as more and more countries hoard whatever medical supplies they can get — with some, like Germany, even banning most PPE exports. So as demand increased due to Covid-19 — not just from health care workers but from a general public increasingly scared of infection — there was less supply to go around.","1602940886","11"
"218","A survey conducted by the University of California Berkeley and UC San Francisco between March 7 and April 9 found that only 19 percent of essential workers at companies such as Walmart, McDonald’s, Costco, Amazon, UPS, and Walgreens were given masks, while 56 percent said their employer made gloves available. In the weeks since the survey was taken, companies may have implemented more protective rules, though guidelines often vary by state. ","1602940886","11"
"219","Besides masking the extent of the pandemic, widespread asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission could also necessitate blunter forms of social distancing since it means that someone staying home if they have symptoms may not be enough.

"227","They’re not alone. Trump himself declined to wear a mask while being photographed at the plant, though he claims he wore one “backstage.” Vice President Mike Pence was criticized for failing to wear a mask during a tour of the Mayo Clinic in April. And when armed protesters showed up at the Michigan statehouse on April 30 to protest stay-at-home orders amid the coronavirus pandemic, many were mask-free. One shouting, bare-faced man who was photographed at the rally later said he was “not at all” worried about the virus and would never wear a mask — “ever.”","1604655221","11"
"228","Since the pandemic began, the issue of wearing masks has further exposed America’s racial and gender prejudices. Earlier on, wearing masks was associated with Asian countries and often dismissed because of racist assumptions about those countries. Then, as many cities began to require residents to wear masks, police began targeting black men for covering their faces, profiling them as criminals rather than as people trying to abide by health guidelines. And for a certain subset of mostly white, conservative men, not wearing a mask seems to have become a hallmark of manliness.","1604655221","11"
"229","For unmasked protesters like the ones in Michigan, “There’s an assumption of a kind of invincibility that is tied to this idea of white masculinity,” Jonathan Metzl, a professor of sociology and psychiatry at Vanderbilt University and the author of Dying of Whiteness: How the Politics of Racial Resentment Is Killing America’s Heartland, told Vox.","1604655221","11"
"230","It’s not just men — Frank noticed many women among the unmasked Trump supporters gathered at the Honeywell plant. And, of course, many men are happy to follow the recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to cover their faces in public. Still, a narrative has emerged on the right that wearing a mask is weak and refusing to wear one is somehow strong. And that narrative could put everyone at risk.","1604655221","11"
"231","Long before the pandemic hit, masks were common in East Asian countries, where they’re seen as a simple way to protect yourself (and others) from disease, as Refinery29’s Connie Wang wrote in March. Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus outbreak began, started requiring them in January. The US was much slower to recommend masks for the general public, but in early April — with confirmed coronavirus cases jumping by the day — the CDC recommended that everyone wear a cloth mask in certain public settings. Some cities, like New York and Los Angeles, began mandating the wearing of masks in certain settings as well.","1604655221","11"
"232","Like much about the coronavirus, the impact of wearing masks on transmission isn’t entirely clear. But many experts believe that even cloth masks can offer some degree of protection for wearers — and perhaps greater protection for the people around them. The virus seems to spread “when germ-containing droplets make it into a person’s mouth, nose, or eyes,” as Vox’s German Lopez previously reported, and it’s true that “masks stop people from spreading their own droplets.” If everyone wears a mask — including those who are asymptomatic but may still be carrying the virus — it could help halt the spread of Covid-19.","1604655221","11"
"233","Most Americans appear to be on board with the CDC’s recommendation. In a Morning Consult poll (conducted from April 7 to 9), 72 percent of respondents said they planned to start wearing a face mask in public places over the next two weeks.","1604655221","11"
"234","Others, however, have chafed at the CDC’s advice. As people around the country protest their state’s shelter-in-place orders, many have appeared in public without masks. One example is the protesters in Michigan, which has become a hotbed of resistance to social distancing restrictions — a defiance Trump has encouraged via his tweets about “liberating” Michigan and other states. And on April 30, hundreds of protesters gathered at the state capitol in Lansing, some of them armed and many of them eschewing masks and standing close together in violation of social distancing guidelines, according to Reuters.","1604655221","11"
"235","One of the mask-less protesters was Brian Cash, who was photographed shouting during the event. He later told the Detroit Free Press he believes the coronavirus was “intentionally released” by the Chinese government and that the state’s stay-at-home order is useless because people still go to grocery stores and pharmacies. “So what is the point of staying at home?” he asked.","1604655221","11"
"236","The resistance to masks has also found support within the Trump administration. Pence, the head of the federal government’s coronavirus response, said he did not wear a mask while touring the Mayo Clinic in April because he is tested for Covid-19 regularly. (He later backpedaled and said he “should have” worn one.) But a mask-less Pence attended two events in Iowa on May 8, the same day his press secretary tested positive for the virus, according to the Intercept. At one of those events, CEOs were reportedly asked to remove their masks before joining Pence onstage.","1604655221","11"

"238","Aides tested positive for the virus days later, and staffers have since been asked to wear masks on White House grounds, according to the Washington Post. Trump, however, is still unlikely to wear a mask himself, aides say.","1604655221","11"
"239","The Trump administration’s behavior around masks has gendered overtones. For Trump and Pence, not wearing a mask may be a way to project a macho image, Metzl said, playing into “tropes of indestructibility.”","1604655221","11"
"240","Such militaristic, tough-guy messaging, along with Trump’s refusal to wear a mask, may encourage ordinary people — especially men — to minimize the risk of coronavirus for the sake of appearing manly.","1604655221","11"
"241","While the refusal to wear masks isn’t an exclusively male phenomenon — a Michigan woman was arrested last month after police said she attacked a grocery store employee who told her to leave because she wasn’t wearing a mask — there is some evidence that men may view mask recommendations with more skepticism than women. In the April Morning Consult poll, 76 percent of women said they planned to wear a face mask in public over the next two weeks, compared with 67 percent of men.","1604655221","11"
"242","Though Trump’s narrative around the virus may be reinforcing gender stereotypes, the issue of masks is revealing Americans’ racial biases as well. While white men have been able to appear in public without masks — and with guns — as part of a protest, black men have been targeted by police, both for wearing and for not wearing masks. In Philadelphia, officers were caught on video forcibly removing a black man from a bus for not covering his face, just one day after the city began requiring it, Fabiola Cineas reported for Vox in April. And a police officer in Miami handcuffed and arrested Armen Henderson, a black doctor who tests homeless people for Covid-19, as he loaded equipment into a van in front of his home — while wearing a mask.","1604655221","11"
"243","Black Americans often have to engage in “social signaling” to make white people feel comfortable in public spaces, said Price, the political science professor. “You say good morning first, you smile first,” she said. “None of that can be done with masks.”","1604655221","11"
"244","White people often already perceive black people as dangerous or not belonging in public places, Price said. “But a black body with a mask is something that somehow expresses even more danger.”","1604655221","11"
"245","Meanwhile, for white protesters like those in Michigan, not wearing a mask may signal a kind of immunity from danger — or at least a perceived immunity. As white Americans, they’re unlikely to encounter the same kind of police brutality that black people face when they engage in protest. “Imagine 10 black men and rifles walking up to any state capitol in the United States,” Price said. “They would be shot before they ever made it up the steps.”","1604655221","11"
"246","But congregating in crowds without masks is also a statement of perceived immunity from the virus, Metzl said. The unmasked protesters seemed to be sending the message that “nothing’s going to happen to me because of my whiteness,” he explained. “If you thought you were really going to get the coronavirus, you wouldn’t act like that.”","1604655221","11"
"247","Obviously, the feeling of invincibility that leads protesters to avoid masks could backfire if they get sick. Pence and Trump may also find themselves rethinking their stance in the coming days since White House officials tested positive — Pence himself is reportedly keeping his distance from Trump and other staffers to avoid potentially exposing them.","1604655221","11"
"248","But the especially disturbing thing about refusing to wear a mask is that, while it may seem like an expression of toughness, it actually increases the risk to others more than yourself, Metzl said. While some may feel that not wearing a mask expresses their own invincibility, “You could also think about this in terms of all the other people you’re putting at risk by not wearing a mask,” he added — your family, friends, colleagues, the rest of society. The failure to wear one is “symbolic of a kind of loss of a bigger common sense of responsibility to each other.”","1604655221","11"
"249","Remedying that loss is not going to be as simple as sending the message that “tough guys wear masks,” Metzl said. (Washington Post humor columnist Alexandra Petri has suggested a tagline for a potential “Masks For Him” line of accessories: “We put the ‘mask’ in ‘toxic maskulinity.’”) Rather, the country has to look at what the current mask debate says about racism and other prejudices. “What we need is a much more concerted effort to address the bigger issues that are represented by masks,” Metzl said.","1604655221","11"
"250","For the Arizona Republic’s Frank, the confrontation over masks outside the Honeywell plant is part of a wider narrative around the virus. She recalled another incident in which a female reporter was accosted, this time by a woman, for wearing a mask. “I do think that what happened to all of us out there in the field on Tuesday is indicative of a larger issue” with how masks are viewed in the US, Frank said.","1604655221","11"
"251","But for her, wearing a mask is about one thing: public health. Frank lives with her mother, a nurse who treats Covid-19 patients. “I try to be really careful,” she told the people gathered outside the plant. “I try to protect myself and those around me.”","1604655221","11"
"252","Wearing masks is really important for reducing coronavirus transmission. A study by a team of five researchers out of Hong Kong and several European universities calculates that if 80 percent of a population can be persuaded to don masks, that would cut transmission levels to one-twelfth of what you’d have in a mask-less society. Widespread use of masks is likely part of the reason Japan’s coronavirus outbreak has been mild thus far, and grassroots mobilization starting with masks is almost universally seen as part of the Hong Kong success story.","1605378028","11"
"253","For the broad population, the key fact is that while wearing a mask does little to protect the wearer from the risk of getting infected, it does a lot to prevent the risk that the wearer spreads the virus to other people. Consequently, an interdisciplinary Yale team featuring biologists, medical doctors, economists, and public health specialists calculates that “the benefits of each additional cloth mask worn by the public are conservatively in the $3,000-$6,000 range due to their impact in slowing the spread of the virus.” And the benefits of professional-grade masks for health care workers may be even higher.","1605378028","11"
"254","A huge barrier to increasing production of either kind of mask is that nobody knows how long high levels of demand will last. Prestige Ameritech, a Texas-based company and the largest American manufacturer of surgical masks in the United States, thought the surge in demand associated with the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009 would be a godsend. But in a recent NPR interview, co-owner Michael Bowen recalls that efforts to scale up rapidly during that crisis nearly killed the company.","1605378028","11"
"255","Caleb Watney from the R Street Institute and Alec Stapp from the Progressive Policy Institute suggest avoiding this situation with an idea that will recur several times on this list: The federal government should agree to pay above the pre-crisis market rate and guarantee that it will buy lots of masks and lots of respirators for an extended period. That gives business owners confidence to invest. The risk is that the country ends up “wasting” money on unneeded equipment if things end up going better than expected. But surplus equipment can be stockpiled so the US doesn’t get caught short in the next pandemic, or can be donated to lower-income countries that don’t have the financial capacity to engage in massive purchase guarantees.","1605378028","11"
"256","Wearing a mask is one of the easiest ways to contribute to the fight against coronavirus. ","1605636133","11"
"257","Infected people wearing masks are less likely to spray virus-containing droplets onto others, which means that universal mask-wearing should, in theory, make everyone safer. There’s some evidence from across the world that suggests the widespread use of masks has played a role in reducing coronavirus transmission. Studies on mask-wearing generally support it, finding that masks generally provide at least some protection. At worst, masks are a low-cost intervention that might help at the margins.","1605636133","11"
"258","But in recent weeks, mask-wearing in the United States has become another flashpoint in the partisan culture wars.","1605636133","11"
"259","President Trump refuses to wear a mask in public appearances — including one at a factory that produces masks — or in his office, despite a recent outbreak among the White House staff. Vice President Mike Pence opted not to wear one when he visited the Mayo Clinic, a prominent medical facility in Minnesota that’s treating coronavirus patients. Many Republicans in Congress have opted not to wear masks on the House and Senate floors, despite several members of their caucus testing positive for the illness earlier this spring. ","1605636133","11"
"260","People tend to take signals from their political leadership, and rank-and-file Republicans appear to have gotten the message. New research from three political scientists —  Syracuse’s Shana Gadarian, UC-Irvine’s Sara Goodman, and Cornell’s Tom Pepinsky — analyzed polling data on over 2,400 Americans’ attitudes and self-reported behaviors during the pandemic. They find that, after controlling for “a full set” of confounding variables, partisanship is a fairly strong predictor of one’s likelihood of wearing a mask.","1605636133","11"
"261","“Democrats are more than 20 percentage points more likely than Republicans to (75% versus 53%) to report wearing masks in public,” Pepinsky writes in a blog post summarizing their findings. “Mask-wearing levels are consistently lower across the board in states that voted strongly for Trump.”","1605636133","11"
"262","Why would Republicans treat masks as a partisan issue?","1605636133","11"
"263","A series of tweets from R.R. Reno, the editor of the conservative religious magazine First Things, is clarifying: In a diatribe that went viral on Tuesday night for all the wrong reasons, Reno praised Trump for failing to wear a mask when meeting a group of World War II veterans — and went on to describe the very idea of masks as a kind of surrender:","1605636133","11"
"264","By the way, the WWII vets did not wear masks. They're men, not cowards. Masks=enforced cowardice.","1605636133","11"
"265","Just to reinforce. Talked to my son in Seattle. The mask culture if fear driven. Masks+cowardice. It's a regime dominate by fear of infection and fear of causing of infection. Both are species of cowardice.","1605636133","11"
"266","Look, let's face it. There are those who are terrified, and those who are not. Where do you stand? Terror or a more reasonable position? Will you visit our mother? If so, the mask is a PC gesture. If not, you are a moral monster.","1605636133","11"
"267","The first thing that leaps out is that the anti-mask crusade reflects a particular vision of masculinity. Reno’s reframing of an obvious public health measure as a kind of cowardice, something tough World War II veterans would never do, is a thinly veiled way of calling protective masks unmanly. As my colleague Anna North argues, this strain of anxious masculinity is a consistent theme in anti-mask arguments on the right.","1605636133","11"
"268","The second is the argument that mask-wearing is a form of “political correctness.” Reno’s reasoning is incoherent — if you’re willing to visit your mother, presumably you should take mask-wearing even more seriously — but it illustrates the category of thinking he’s relying on here. The question in his mind is not “does wearing a mask contribute to public health,” but rather “what does wearing a mask say about where I stand in the culture war.” He sees the issue not through the lens of substance, but of symbolism.","1605636133","11"
"269","When you look at the broader Republican response to masks through the lens of Reno’s thinking, it starts to make a lot more sense. This is a political movement that has been built to wage a culture war; it has no greater objective than owning the libs. And the best way to own them is to defeat them in combat over identity: gender, race, sexuality, and the like.","1605636133","11"
"270","The war on masks is a way of taking a public health crisis — a situation that demands political unity and best practices in governance — and reshaping it into a culture war competition. The question is not “are we doing a good job handling this” so much as “whose team do you want to be on, the namby-pamby liberals or the strong fearless conservatives?” ","1605636133","11"
"271","It is difficult for members of the modern organized conservative movement to see political issues outside the lenses of partisanship and the culture wars. At a time when unity on public health matters is paramount, on issues ranging from masks to testing to the timing of reopening, this is dangerous.","1605636133","11"
"272","This month, two shoppers at a Target in Los Angeles fought a security guard, breaking his arm, when he tried to tell them to follow the store policy and wear masks. The American Covid-19 response has been befuddling to say the least; at times, it seems like we are facing two battles — one against the virus, and one against each other. ","1606702497","11"
"273","A central part of this frustration between fellow Americans has been a failure of leadership to unite us against a common enemy. With confusion and inconsistency around everything from masks to medications, it’s become harder to navigate information and misinformation, find direction, or even know if we are going in the wrong one. ","1606702497","11"
"274","Universal mask-wearing is one example: Opponents, including the CDC early on, have  said that universal masking has not yet been proven to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. While it is true that we aren’t sure what the effect of universal masking at a population level will be, that is because we have not had time to study this effect with Covid-19 yet. This doesn’t mean masks won’t help us greatly — it means we aren’t completely sure if and how much they will. ","1606702497","11"
"275","Here, the practice of weighing risks and benefits can help us realize that masks are worth using. The potential benefits of consistent universal masking, particularly if using a high-filtrate equivalent mask, like N95, are huge. We could potentially prevent thousands of deaths, slow the spread significantly, and eventually drive R0 (a measure of how quickly the disease spreads) consistently below 1, forcing the epidemic to burn out. ","1606702497","11"
"276","If masks are not all that they were cut out to be, we really don’t lose much. Some have also argued that there is a risk that masks may reduce how much people physically distance (thinking they are safe), but there is no data to support this “risk-compensation” argument. The same was assumed for seat belts — the possibility they would increase reckless driving — and that was shown to be untrue. The CDC has endorsed population-level masking, and many have felt they should have done this much sooner. ","1606702497","11"
"277","Acting without robust data can be reckless and harmful when the risks are just as great, if not greater, than the possible benefits. Medicine’s mantra of “First, do no harm” must temper the predisposition of leadership to act too fast and rely on unproven treatments. With masks, the risk of being wrong — that masks don’t have a huge benefit at the population level — leaves us still with our remaining strategies of testing, tracing, and isolating, and likely does not set us back significantly. But with unproven medicines, there is a much quicker path to making life and death calculations. Here, taking a chance is a much higher-stake move.","1606702497","11"
"278","As the gravity of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States took hold in March, Walgreens decided to let its workers wear jeans. It would be nearly two weeks before the pharmacy announced it was also giving them masks.","1607758629","11"
"279","“The jeans thing I would say was within two weeks or so of getting locked down. The gloves and mask timing pissed me off, though. Everyone else had them, and it would take almost three weeks or so, before the company got them to us,” one New Jersey Walgreens worker told me. “We kept asking our manager when we would get them.”","1607758629","11"
"280","“While some of these other examples are not as egregious as the calendar, workers think these incentives are a slap in the face as their demands for sufficient PPE, paid sick days, and pandemic pay go unaddressed,” said Allynn Umel, organizing director for Fight for $15, in an emailed statement. “On top of that, in the middle of this crisis, while workers were begging for masks, McDonald’s dished out nearly $1 billion in dividends to its shareholders. It’s wrong to hand out cash to shareholders while workers struggle for health and economic protections.”","1607758629","11"
"281","In practice, it’s messier. R0 — pronounced r-nought, the virus’s basic reproductive number that describes how many new cases are generated, on average, from a single infection — is not a set figure. It can change in different environments, in different populations, and when people adopt behaviors like mask-wearing and hand-washing. ","1607758606","11"
"282","Don’t take all of this to mean that we’re going to have to stay in lockdown until at least 2022. There is a middle ground between lockdown and going back completely to the way things were. A massive campaign of universal masking, testing, contact tracing, and isolating suspected cases and their contacts could help reduce transmission while getting our lives a little bit back to normal.","1607758606","11"
"283","“I want to be optimistic and say that we can come to a place that is less extreme than what we’re in now,” Tedijanto says. There’s no one silver bullet, she says, to defeat Covid-19. But some combination of universal face mask-wearing, better data on transmission hot spots (and how to avoid them), and enhanced testing and contact tracing is likely to pave a middle-ground path. ","1607758606","11"
"284","The US’s case volumes and daily death tolls have fallen over the course of May, which has generated lots of talk of bent curves and peaks. But there’s no mechanical reason that caseloads can’t rise as people start to travel again, as businesses reopen, and as even basic precautions like wearing a mask become fodder for culture wars.","1608476875","11"
"285","It’s not as simple as getting an all-clear. When studios do open across the country, they’ll likely have to adopt changes including limited capacity and health protocols, like making clients wear face masks.","1609210079","11"
"286","Epidemiologists I spoke to echoed the research letter, in that this combination of potentially contaminated surfaces and objects, the lack of social distancing, and heavy breathing makes fitness studios extremely risky. And minimizing that risk through things like masks, ventilation, and thorough cleaning is absolutely key.","1609210079","11"
"287","“Gyms can be difficult places to maintain social distancing and the volume of high-touch surfaces and objects makes them uniquely challenging for infection prevention efforts,” Saskia Popescu, an infection prevention epidemiologist and biodefense researcher, told me. “Moreover, in those environments where social distancing is difficult, the CDC has recommended masks, which you can’t really do when working out.”","1609210079","11"
"288","Providing masks for clients, reducing capacity, and maintaining at least six feet of distance are the basic, foundational directives epidemiologists prescribe. Fitness companies are taking note, with some of them even taking extra steps.","1609210079","11"
"289","Barry’s instituted new cleaning rules and even shut down its studios before states like New York and California implemented shelter-in-place directives. Joey Gonzalez, the CEO, explained to me over email that the company has put together a council of health experts to advise them on further steps they need to take to reopen, which include limiting the number of people in the room; making masks and gloves available for clients and requiring them for staff; and eliminating showers and locker room access during the initial phase of reopening.  ","1609210079","11"
"290","The spin company, known for its devout following and sweaty workouts, says it will: start rotating its rental shoes and lockers so they’re not used twice in a row; implement a hands-free check-in; begin administering health checks for staff and instructors, and do the same for riders where state or local governments mandate it. They’ll also remove gum, Q-tips, and razors from the studios and bathrooms, limit water fountain usage to emergencies, pare down the number of available bikes in a room, and eliminate showers. They’re still considering requiring their riders to wear masks.","1609210079","11"
"291","Doing all that already uncomfortable stuff while wearing a mask? While breathing in my own exercise breath? While adjusting said mask every so often? I can already imagine rotating my feet, twisting my torso, and heading out the door.","1609210079","11"
"292","Exercise devotees not wanting to work out with a mask — experts told Runners World that the disdain is understandable because masks inhibit performance and are, surprise, uncomfortable — is a big fear group fitness founders and CEOs have.","1609210079","11"
"293","The researchers could not account for every conceivable variable. They note that they do not attempt to measure how mask-wearing or closing public parks and beaches or restrictions on visits to nursing homes might affect Covid-19’s spread and impact. Nevertheless, over the period they studied, the percentage of the US population subjected to these government policies grew to 95 percent — and the effect they find on the coronavirus is sizable.","1610134081","11"
"294","Research like this new Health Affairs paper provides more information about what works best and what doesn’t. They also gesture at other variables they did not measure that warrant more study, such as mask-wearing or activities at public parks. We have to seek a middle ground between maintaining the social distancing policies that have worked to slow the spread and the natural need for social interaction and the urgency of relieving the economic crisis. ","1610134081","11"
"295","One reason that could help explain the stark disparity: In Hong Kong, nearly everyone wears a face mask in public.","1610134110","11"
"296","But almost as soon as the outbreak first began in the city, millions of residents started wearing masks in public. One local told the Los Angeles Times that the government didn’t have to say anything before 99 percent of the population put them on.","1610134110","11"
"297","Experts now say widespread mask usage appears to be a major reason, perhaps even the primary one, why the city hasn’t been devastated by the disease.","1610134110","11"

"299","In one way, the ubiquity of Hong Kong’s masks is rather ironic.","1610134110","11"
"300","Starting last spring, pro-democracy activists took to the streets of Hong Kong to protest a set of laws that would give mainland China — which isn’t supposed to have full control over the city until 2047 — more power over Hong Kong. To protect themselves from police tear gas and avoid the city-state’s ubiquitous surveillance cameras, millions of protesters donned masks.","1610134110","11"
"301","In an effort to quash the movement last October, Hong Kong’s China-backed government banned the wearing of face masks in public. The hope was that forcing demonstrators to show their faces would make them stay home instead.","1610134110","11"
"302","As the coronavirus first hit the city, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam fumbled her response, not wearing a mask during a press conference and, eventually, wearing one incorrectly in public. She also asked government employees not to wear masks.","1610134110","11"
"303","By April, public health experts in Hong Kong were calling on the government to not only repeal the mask ban but also to mandate the wearing of masks in public as a means of curbing the coronavirus’s spread.","1610134110","11"
"304","But by then, almost everyone was already wearing them, ban be damned. Indeed, the fact that the government seemed to advocate against masks may have helped make them more popular. Almost in protest, residents started wearing masks in large numbers and helping the most vulnerable communities obtain them.","1610134110","11"
"305","The city has faced pandemics before, including the 1968 flu, which began in Hong Kong and killed about 1 million people worldwide. When SARS came to Hong Kong from mainland China in 2003, residents took it seriously and nearly everyone wore a mask. Partly as a result, the city lost only 300 people during that crisis.","1610134110","11"
"306","Experts say that instilled a sense among the people of Hong Kong that masks are vital to thwarting a pandemic. That sense was reignited when the coronavirus hit. Now they’re everywhere.","1610134110","11"
"307","“Not wearing masks in Hong Kong is like not wearing pants nowadays,” Alex Lam, a Hong Kong lawyer, told the Wall Street Journal in April.","1610134110","11"
"308","As the Journal also noted, some taxi cabs and shops won’t let people inside unless they wear a mask. Someone walking around the city without a mask on invites harsh looks from passersby and even verbal reprimands. Even the public address system on Hong Kong’s metro asks riders to wear masks at all times.","1610134110","11"

"311","Such praise makes sense, as the latest research indicates that near-universal mask-wearing is critical to fighting the coronavirus.","1610134110","11"
"312","It’s worth noting that Hong Kong also implemented a strong testing, tracing, and isolation program, in addition to strengthening travel rules and closing bars at the end of March.

"315","“A mask could catch a lot of the virus a sick person would otherwise be breathing or coughing out,” Ben Cowling, the head of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health and a co-author of the study, told the Wall Street Journal at the time. “Wearing them at least provides some protection for others.”","1610134110","11"
"316","On May 13, Vox’s Matthew Yglesias also pointed out that in April, researchers at the University of Hong Kong and in Europe calculated that if 80 percent of a population can be persuaded to don masks, transmission levels would be cut to one-twelfth of what you’d have in a mask-less society. However, that study has yet to be peer-reviewed.","1610134110","11"
"317","On Sunday, another team from the University of Hong Kong determined that the benefits of face masks were massive. Using 52 hamsters in cages, the team found that non-contact transmission dropped by around 75 percent when masks were present. “The findings implied to the world and the public is that the effectiveness of mask-wearing against the coronavirus pandemic is huge,” Dr. Yuen Kwok-yung told reporters.","1610134110","11"
"318","It does appear, then, that masks are one of the top reasons why the coronavirus situation in Hong Kong isn’t so dire. One wonders whether the rising number of cases and deaths in the US would be lower if Americans similarly adopted such widespread mask-wearing habits.","1610134110","11"
"319","On the production line, the workers are often standing shoulder to shoulder. What’s more, the CDC recently found that workers haven’t been wearing face masks correctly due to the “pace and physical demands of processing work,” only covering their mouths and frequently touching the mask to readjust it.","1610860675","11"
"320","In addition to the protective equipment they have always been required to wear, they’re also wearing masks and face shields now — at least when the plants can obtain them — and they have been practicing social distancing where possible in cafeterias and places where the workers put on their protective equipment.

(A Target spokesperson told The Goods that it’s following all local ordinances regarding mask use. In cities and states where masks aren’t mandatory, the spokesperson said, customers are encouraged to wear them anyway but won’t be turned away if they aren’t.)","1611057303","11"
"325","Employees still wear masks, to protect both each other and the customers, but the masks don’t keep them from getting sick themselves. If customers interacting with employees don’t wear masks, they’re still protected because the employees are wearing them; employee safety, meanwhile, is left in the hands of those customers.","1611057303","11"
"326","Mike Van Dyke, an occupational health professor at the Colorado School of Public Health, told The Goods customers should be “respectful” by wearing masks and “maintaining distance as much as possible” while shopping. “It gets hard in terms of different places across the country,” he said. “Some places have required mask ordinances in place and some places don’t.”","1611057303","11"
"327","Despite this, the fast food giant is treating him and other workers as essential. In a March letter to customers detailing the chain’s new safety protocols, Taco Bell CEO Mark King said franchisees and employees “have an obligation to do something to help stop this from spreading.” All employees, King said, would be required to wear a mask and gloves; there would be contactless temperature checks at the beginning of every shift; the brand would make “every effort to ensure hand sanitizer is always available in the restaurants for team members and customers.”","1611057303","11"
"328","Despite the procedures, Daniel said, customers continued to operate as if it was business as usual. “An alarming amount of [customers] weren’t wearing masks, weren’t wearing gloves when they gave me their card,” he said. “I saw a few coughing into their shirts — I was looking at them through the drive-thru window.” He didn’t feel safe coming to work, but he also couldn’t afford not to.","1611057303","11"
"329","For centers that have stayed open or are reopening, the CDC published relatively detailed guidance in April. Some of these recommendations include taking children’s temperature each day upon arrival (possibly while staff are in full personal protective gear), not using toys that cannot be sanitized, and using cloth masks for children over 2. ","1611226247","11"
"330","And many other guidelines seem incongruous with young kids’ behavior and abilities, such as expecting 3-year-olds to keep masks on all day. ","1611226247","11"
"331","“It would be difficult to have children 3-5 wear [masks] all day with any reliability,” Allison Bartlett, associate medical director of the Infection Control Program and a pediatric infectious disease specialist at University of Chicago Medicine, told Vox. “In addition, kids with masks may be prone to remove them, touch their faces, reposition the masks, etc., contaminating themselves in the process.” ","1611226247","11"
"332","As the authors of a letter in the European Journal of Pediatrics concluded, “If compliance is difficult, it is better that the child does not wear the mask, and other measures for reducing infection risk, including remaining at home, are practiced.”","1611226247","11"
"333","Mullen Davis heard from another parent recently who was worried about her infant surrounded by masked staff for 40 hours a week. “She was concerned about how masks affect language and social emotional development if children cannot see their caregiver’s friendly or responsive face,” she says. “We just don’t have research on this.” ","1611226247","11"
"334","Advocates have been calling for better working conditions for salon workers for years, but now, many say, protections like masks and proper ventilation are more necessary than ever.  Workers and their advocates are also calling on customers for some empathy and support as salons reopen and manicures and pedicures resume.","1611920861","11"
"335","Masks are another issue. Workers have been pushing for years for the right to wear masks to protect them from chemical fumes, but some salons have discouraged them because they make clients uncomfortable, Hallett said. Ramirez says her salon allowed her to wear a mask prior to the pandemic if she brought her own, but customers sometimes asked her to take it off, claiming they couldn’t hear her properly.","1611920861","11"
"336","Now, she says, salons need to be providing masks and gloves for all workers, she said.","1611920861","11"
"337","And, workers and their advocates say, customers need to understand the risks people face in doing their nails. That includes wearing a mask themselves.

"338","As a nation, Americans have experienced a collective trauma that has us longing for a pre-Covid-19 world. A world of grocery shopping without masks, handshakes without fear, and, for many of us, a break from worrying about paying rent and losing loved ones. This desire for normalcy is what underscores the lavish plans people are making when shelter-in-place orders are fully lifted in every state. “When the outside world opens up, I’m throwing the biggest party and hugging everyone I ever met” seems to be the statement most often echoed across social media.

"340","It can be difficult to generalize this. This is really unique, so I wouldn’t put a number on the stages. But there will be a process of adjustment. There will be resistance to the changes. There will be people experiencing reactants — when we feel like a freedom that we have is being threatened. This is why we hear things like, “I thought I had the freedom to go to a movie, and now I don’t.” The requirements to wear masks are creating reactants. Some people are resisting because they feel like the government is telling us we can’t breathe freely. We see this in all the protests. So there will periods of adjustment for this. The key is to look at this with a broader perspective and recognize how we’ve dealt with difficult challenges in the past.","1611920858","11"
"341","Will residents keep up with mask-wearing and social distancing, even when their leaders relax regulations? Plus, there are scientific questions about the virus still not understood: Will it diminish transmission in a seasonal pattern? Do children contribute greatly to its spread? How long does immunity last after an infection? Why do some people breathe out more of the virus than others? The answers to these questions will influence the future, and we do not know the answers.

"342","We may be living in a dystopian society where schools and office buildings sit silent and empty and we can’t leave the house without wearing a mask, but a few things, including the sun rising and setting, the turning of the seasons, and women loathing their looks, remain unchanged.","1611951750","11"
"343","Give yourself at least 45 minutes away from screens before you go to bed, so maybe read a book or keep a journal — just something to allow your mind to calm down before bed. Make sure that your room is cool and that it’s as dark as possible. I’m a fan of a white noise machine; you can buy it online for $20 and plug it in beside your bed to create a steady stream of white noise, which can mask any external sound that might jolt you out of sleep. The machine can help you stay in sleep and help you feel more refreshed when you wake up in the morning. ","1612805919","11"
"344","Some of the advice reflected the message we’ve already heard for months: Wash your hands. Don’t touch your face. Wear a mask. Avoid shared surfaces and crowded settings, and keep physical distance — at least 6 feet — from people you don’t live with. If you’re 65 or older or have chronic health conditions, you should take all of this advice more seriously.","1612860612","11"
"345","After some mixed messaging from federal officials early on in the Covid-19 outbreak, there is widespread consensus that people should wear masks when they go out — a surgical or medical mask if they have one, a cloth one if they don’t. ","1612860612","11"
"346","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends masks “in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.” But other experts — and, in some cases, government mandates — go further, saying you should wear a mask in just about any setting outside your home as long as the pandemic continues.","1612860612","11"
"347","The primary reason for a mask is to stop transmission from the wearer to others, particularly from people who are infected but asymptomatic and therefore might not even know they’re infected. If you wear a mask, you’re less likely to spray virus-containing droplets on surfaces or other people when you breathe, talk, sing, laugh, sigh, snort, cough, sneeze, and whatever else you might do with your mouth and nose.","1612860612","11"
"348","A mask also likely offers some protection to you by creating a physical barrier to droplets from others in front of your mouth and nose (at least if you’re wearing it properly — make sure that it’s covering both).","1612860612","11"
"349","The initial research on masks wasn’t great, but it’s getting stronger. Several recent studies found masks alone reduce transmission. Some experts hypothesize — and early research suggests — that masks played a significant role in containing Covid-19 outbreaks in several Asian countries where their use is widespread, like South Korea and Japan.","1612860612","11"
"350","It can still be difficult, depending on where you live, to find medical masks. But there are cloth alternatives you can make at home. The CDC has an extensive tutorial. And here’s one from the US surgeon general:","1612860612","11"
"351","There are also things you can do to help others wear masks. For example, if you’re hosting a large event or even throwing a party — not advisable, but it will happen — offer masks to the people attending.","1612860612","11"
"352","When wearing a mask, don’t fidget with it — that would be touching your face — and avoid taking it off until you’re back home. Throw away disposable masks once they’re used, and wash reusable masks after you use them. ","1612860612","11"
"353","Masks are not an excuse to ease off on other hygiene practices. In fact, you want to wash your hands before and after taking off a mask — before, to avoid getting anything on your face and mask, and after, to get rid of anything that was on your mask.","1612860612","11"
"354","And yes, it’s normal to have a slightly harder time breathing while wearing a mask for a long time. But that discomfort should be weighed against the risk of getting sick or infecting others without a mask.","1612860612","11"
"355","It’s also possible to mitigate the risk of breaches in a closed circle by following the other tips on this list: Even when hanging out with your closed circle, go outside when possible, wear a mask, follow good hygiene, and keep physical distance from each other. A closed circle doesn’t have to be a license for much riskier behavior; it can just be an extra layer of protection if you want to regularly see other humans in person.","1612860612","11"
"356","Still, female leaders may have walked into the current crisis with a few advantages over men. In some cases, male leaders seem to feel the need to appear “super-masculine and super-strong and inflexible” in the face of the pandemic, Jalalzai said. Trump, for example, has repeatedly asserted that he is in control of the Covid-19 crisis, and at times has sought to demonstrate that control in ways that both run counter to public health advice and set a damaging precedent, like when he neglects to wear a mask in public appearances or talks about taking hydroxychloroquine, a drug that has no proven benefit against Covid-19, to keep from getting infected with the virus.","1613286620","11"
"357","The decision of some Americans to not wear a mask in public has become a political act, the latest demonstration of how misinformation is complicating the American response to the Covid-19 pandemic. ","1613286616","11"
"358","As states reopen, enforcement of new mask requirements in public spaces has led to conflict: A Target employee in California broke his arm after trying to remove two customers refusing to wear masks. In Flint, Michigan, a security guard at a Family Dollar store was shot and killed after a dispute with a disgruntled customer over wearing a face mask. ","1613286616","11"
"359","A urologist in Florida, who requested anonymity because of fear of losing his job, tells Vox he had his first patient refuse to wear a mask on May 13. The doctor works at a private clinic, which recently instituted a policy requiring all patients to wear a mask while in the building to minimize transmission of the virus. The patient was given a mask at the front desk, but refused to put it on. ","1613286616","11"
"360","“The nurse asked him to put his mask on if he wanted to be seen,” the urologist said. “He got verbally aggressive with her, saying he had a right not to wear a mask, and that we were denying his constitutional rights.” The clinic manager was summoned to speak with the patient, and explained that the mask was to protect both him and the medical staff. “He continued to refuse, so the administration asked him to leave.” ","1613286616","11"
"361","The dispatcher declined to send an officer to the scene, but the clinic then called the police. “He ended up walking out of the building before the cops showed up.” The mask is, the urologist says, “not just for his safety. It’s for the safety of those around him.” ","1613286616","11"
"362","It’s difficult to gauge how widespread a problem mask refusal is, and it’s probably uncommon. A recent HuffPost/YouGov poll found that most Americans say they’re mostly or always wearing masks when they’re in public and around others.","1613286616","11"
"363","Nearly 70% of Americans say wearing a mask near others is respectful. Just 8% see it as a sign of weakness. https://t.co/FyfceHGs05 pic.twitter.com/Q00Oi4bqhW","1613286616","11"
"364","But medical professionals interviewed by Vox in three states say health care workers are at times being put at risk by people refusing to wear masks in health care facilities. This rejection of a public health measure only adds to the threats to front-line health care workers, who remain at higher risk of Covid-19 infection, especially in the continued shortage of protective gear, like masks, gloves, and surgical gowns.","1613286616","11"
"365","Some of the potential confusion about mask-wearing stems from changing recommendations from health authorities. In February, the US surgeon general told Americans to “stop buying masks” because they allegedly would not protect users from infection, and that health care workers needed them first. By early April, however, the CDC changed its guidance to recommend people cover their faces in “public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.” ","1613286616","11"
"366","As the CDC told NPR, recent studies have demonstrated that the virus is frequently spread when people are presymptomatic and asymptomatic. As many as 31 percent of people with Covid-19 may be asymptomatic, and people can be infected for two to 14 days before developing symptoms. Precisely because you might not know who has been infected on a crowded sidewalk, in a hospital, or a doctor’s office, other people’s masks protect you, and your mask protects them. ","1613286616","11"
"367","SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus, is very, very small, and surgical and homemade masks are not as effective as the N95 masks worn by health care workers at filtering the virus. (One study shows the type of fabric used changes homemade masks’ efficacy, with T-shirt fabric performing the best of the tested materials.) Yet researchers say they still seem to reduce the transmissibility of the virus by reducing the transmission of infected droplets.","1613286616","11"
"368","For this reason, a growing number of doctors, scientists, and public health experts are now calling for universal masking in indoor public spaces and crowded outdoor spaces. One recent study, not yet through peer review, analyzed data from Hong Kong, where near-universal masking was voluntarily adopted very early in the pandemic. It suggests coronavirus transmission may drop as much as 75 percent when surgical masks are used. And other studies suggest that if mask use were universal, it would control transmission even better than a strict lockdown. Especially as the US begins to reopen, masks will be critical tools to help control public transmission. ","1613286616","11"
"369","This evidence-based message, however, has been politicized in the US, with mask refusal by some on the right becoming a symbol on the right for personal freedoms.","1613286616","11"
"370","A poll published May 7 by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research suggests 76 percent of Democrats wear a mask when they leave home, compared to 59 percent of Republicans. ","1613286616","11"
"371","The divide is also evident in top Republican leadership. Even as two White House aides tested positive for Covid-19 — including one of President Trump’s personal valets and Katie Miller, the Vice President’s press secretary — the president recently told advisers wearing a mask would make him “look ridiculous.” ","1613286616","11"
"372","Vice President Mike Pence has followed Trump’s lead, recently refusing to wear a mask when touring the Mayo Clinic, a medical center in Rochester, Minnesota.

"374","After Pence’s tour, Fox News’s Laura Ingraham doubled down on rejecting masks, saying, “social control over large populations is achieved through fear and intimidation and suppression of free thought.” Republican Ohio state representative, Nino Vitale, is required by Ohio’s department of health to wear a mask, but is so far refusing. “We are all created in the image and likeness of God. That image is seen the most by our face,” he wrote on Facebook, ","1613286616","11"
"375","Part of the problem, explains Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease epidemiologist, is the early mixed messaging on masks created space for doubt in the public’s understanding of masks’ benefits. “Anytime there is uncertainty, there is opportunity for harnessing that for politicization — which is frustrating, as novel outbreaks like Covid-19 inherently have uncertainty.” ","1613286616","11"
"376","A nurse at a VA hospital in Kansas, who requested anonymity because of fear of losing her job, also told Vox about a patient who refused to wear a mask this month. “We have a mask policy for all employees and all patients,” she says. Because personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies at the hospital are still limited, nurses are given one surgical mask per day, and patients without masks are loaned cloth masks that the hospital launders after they’ve been used. ","1613286616","11"
"377","The patient was “ranting and raving,” she says. “He said he had been trying to get it and hadn’t caught it, so he didn’t think he needed to wear a mask. I wish I could be that confident and willing to take everyone in this building’s lives into my hands.” ","1613286616","11"
"378","Despite his refusal to don a mask, the patient was cared for, although staff wore gowns and masks as if he had Covid-19. “Some [staff] were irritated,” he was treated, the nurse says, “but it’s not their job to strong-arm someone out of the clinic. What do you want them to do?” ","1613286616","11"
"379","She’s uncertain of what will happen the next time a patient refuses a mask. Although the entire VA medical system requires everyone coming into a medical facility to wear a mask, the nurse’s clinic doesn’t have security staff to enforce it.   So far, all the management has done is give staff permission to wear additional PPE if patients refuse to follow the mask policy. ","1613286616","11"
"380","Ryan Shannon, an ER doctor in Florida, describes a patient refusing to wear a mask, even though she was in a room next to an immunocompromised person at high risk of severe Covid-19 illness and death. “She refused, threw the mask on the floor, and proceeded to berate myself and my staff for being a part of the ‘conspiracy and hoax’ that is Covid-19,” he wrote in a May 11 Facebook post. ","1613286616","11"
"381","After the patient’s refusal to follow guidelines, her husband insisted on sitting in the part of the waiting room designated for patients with respiratory complaints like Covid-19, instead of in his car as he was instructed. “We are at the point where social media has turned into a cesspool of misinformation. Misinformation that puts people’s lives at risk,” Shannon wrote. “We are at the point where we have politicized a pandemic. Where one’s political belief almost determines whether or not they wear a mask,” he concluded. “Just wear the bloody mask.”","1613286616","11"
"382","Yet mask rules at health care facilities are not consistent state by state or clearly communicated to staff who have to enforce them. Medical boards of some states, like Texas, have issued clear requirements state-wide that “a mask must be worn by both the patient and physician.” But Florida, for example, appears to have not issued universal guidelines for mask-use, leaving these decisions up to individual facilities — meaning mask rules could vary from hospital to hospital. ","1613286616","11"
"383","Confusion about when and where masks should be worn is also playing out in other high-risk places that provide medical care, like nursing homes. Sue Krohn-Taylor is an administrator at a 72-apartment low-income senior living facility in the large town of Grand Island, Nebraska, where a resident has tested positive for Covid-19. She says she’s been battling some residents who refuse to wear masks, and is exhausted. ","1613286616","11"
"384","“This week, the son of one of the residents told me I was taking away their liberties by making them wear a mask in the common areas,” she says. “If they were only harming themselves, I would back off, but they are placing each and every resident here, and my staff, and our families in harm’s way.”","1613286616","11"
"385","When you go out, also take the now-familiar precautions: Wash your hands. Don’t touch your face. Wear a mask, particularly in indoor public spaces. Avoid shared surfaces and crowded settings, and keep physical distance — at least 6 feet — from people you don’t live with. If you’re 65 or older or have chronic health conditions that could exacerbate Covid-19, you should take all of this advice more seriously.","1614091526","11"
"386","From these studies, one thing is clear: The main way people are getting sick with SARS-CoV-2 is from respiratory droplets spreading between people in close quarters. The risk of catching the coronavirus, simply put, “is breathing in everybody’s breath,” says Charles Haas, an environmental engineer at Drexel University. Droplets fly from people’s mouths and noses when they breathe, talk, or sneeze. Other people can breathe them in. That’s the main risk, and that’s why face masks are an essential precaution (they help stop the droplets from spewing far from a person’s mouth or nose). ","1614091522","11"
"387","The employees are at a much larger risk due to the time they spent working in the store. Both the employees and shoppers were in the same physical space, but their risk was not the same. (The study did not note whether the shoppers and customers were wearing masks in the store.) The employees may have interacted more with their colleagues, but they also had a greater chance of breathing in the virus. ","1614091522","11"
"388","“Wearing a mask is not going to completely reduce your risk, hand-washing is not going to completely reduce your risk, and staying a distance away from people in an enclosed space is not going to completely reduce your risk,” Haas, the Drexel professor, says. “But the concurrent use of all those strategies will hopefully reduce your risk down to a lower level. We can never get to zero. There’s no such thing as zero risk.”","1614091522","11"
"389","And we still need more data, and follow-up on potential exposures. A hair salon in Missouri made headlines when a couple of their hair stylists were reportedly back at work after testing positive for Covid-19. Both hairdressers wore masks, and so did their clients, and a follow-up investigation by their county health department revealed no new infections among the 140 clients they saw. ","1614091522","11"
"390","This data point is a bit anecdotal. “I think they got lucky,” Bromage says. “But it does highlight the importance of masks.” Perhaps more data will reveal that getting a haircut while everyone is wearing a mask is a low-risk activity. ","1614091522","11"

"392","Ultimately, it went fine. My partner wore a mask, took the baby into the hospital, got him his shots, and came home. The hospital screened them at the entrance for coronavirus symptoms; everyone was wearing masks; the hallways were deserted. Neither my partner nor the baby got sick. ","1614726086","11"
"393","I think that would be a little bleak. I would say that the president does matter. I was talking to a friend the other day and he said that if Trump put on a mask at a press conference and said, “I’m doing this because it’s a smart thing to do,” that would matter to some people who are resistant, that signal from someone they trust would matter. So it’s not that leadership is irrelevant, but I do think there are real limits to what’s possible in the country and the origins of that stretch back to our founding. ","1615373575","11"
"394","The question for me is, does that translate into behavior? The psychologist in me can see that 80 percent of Americans think masks are a good idea, for example, but does that mean 80 percent of Americans are actually wearing masks?

"409","Trump’s retweet mocking Biden for wearing a mask was far from his only objectionable post. He also posted tweets over the weekend pushing a baseless conspiracy meant to implicate a prominent critic of his, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, in the death of a woman named Lori Klausutis. (Trump has repeatedly falsely characterized the situation as a “cold case” — in fact, the woman died of natural causes.)","1617452892","11"
"410","In Germany, students administer coronavirus tests on themselves to track if they have the disease or not. In Vietnam, children and adults get their temperatures checked before entering the school building and wear masks once inside. And in New Zealand, parents or students worried about returning too soon can delay returning until they feel comfortable.","1618107553","11"
"411","In mid-May, the New York Times told the story of Lea Hammermeister, a 17-year-old high school junior in the small northern German town of Neustrelitz. Before going to class, she grabbed a coronavirus test kit, swabbed her throat, and then properly prepared the device for evaluation. Later that night, she received the result in her email: negative. That allowed her to wear a green sticker, which means she can walk freely about the school without a mask. ","1618107553","11"
"412","In the meantime, schools in Germany continue to follow new directives for reopening schools: Hallways are now one-way avenues, masks must be worn in classrooms, seats are assigned and spaced far apart, and everyone is encouraged to wear heavier clothing as windows must be kept open to improve air circulation. All of that is in addition to already common practices such as keeping a 6-foot distance between students when standing in line.","1618107553","11"
"413","After a three-month hiatus, Vietnam’s 22 million school-age students were allowed to return to their classrooms this month after first passing a mandatory temperature check at their school’s entrance. If a child doesn’t have a fever, they’re allowed to attend classes, but they must wear a mask throughout the entire school day. One school in Hanoi, the capital, bought 10,000 masks to ensure it had enough for students to use.","1618107553","11"
"414","Some may find wearing a mask for hours cumbersome, but 11-year-old Pham Anh Kiet, who attends a western Hanoi school, doesn’t mind. “I feel safe when I wear a mask and have my temperature checked, I am not afraid of being infected with the virus,” he told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on May 4. ","1618107553","11"
"415","Still, the widespread use of masks in Vietnamese schools may minimize that risk.","1618107553","11"
"416","Two months later, it seems as though the sheer volume of garbage that gets dumped into the platforms may overwhelm their efforts to keep a lid on it. Witness the conspiracist “Plandemic” video, which suggests, among other things, that wearing a mask can make you sick: It moved widely around Facebook and YouTube for weeks before the platforms took it down earlier this month.","1618107523","11"
"417","It’s that the coronavirus is more than a public health crisis. It’s an unending series of political arguments, over everything from the Trump administration’s miserable response to the pandemic to the way government aid should be distributed to disputes over mask-wearing or not-wearing. The debate about when and how to open up parts of the country is getting more rancorous and partisan. ","1618107523","11"
"418","These political divides over how to respond to the pandemic have already forced the platforms to make controversial calls. Last month, for instance, Facebook took down event posts for anti-stay-at-home protests in at least three states, on the basis that the events “def[ied] government’s guidance on social distancing.” But in other states with similar rules, Facebook left up similar event posts promoting similar gatherings, which featured closely packed protesters who didn’t wear masks. The takedowns drew immediate criticism from Republicans, including Sens. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley. ","1618107523","11"
"419","So, for example, we’re going to do a Yoga Day, where we’re going to have small groups of 10. Their yoga mats will be 6 feet apart. We’ll make sure to have all the cleaning supplies and we’ll have masks. We’re also planning in-person hikes and other activities our campers wouldn’t be able to do indoors.","1618175839","11"
"420","As the Washington Post notes, Diamond is a “vocal opponent of wearing masks.” On the same day that Diamond began his self-quarantine, he spoke before a Pennsylvania House committee without wearing a mask.","1619264645","11"
"421","In fact, the opposite is true: As some people go out, they increase the number of human beings they’re coming into contact with. Particularly if they don’t take precautions like wearing a mask and maintaining 6 feet of distance, that increases the risk that they’ll pass on the virus to more vulnerable individuals. ","1619292356","11"
"422","Nursing homes and long-term care facilities are in immediate need of more resources: more PPE, more tests, universal masking, and more money to pay staff so they don’t have to work multiple jobs at different sites. The AARP and other groups are advocating for such changes in the US, where one-third of all coronavirus deaths are residents or workers in these facilities, and in Canada, where it’s a whopping 81 percent.","1619292356","11"
"423","While working in Beijing last year, I regularly bought packs of N95 masks at my local 7-Eleven. Across the city, masks were a common accessory: In packed subway cars and crowded bike lanes, commuters wore them for protection from the smog year-round. ","1620204672","11"
"424","When the coronavirus surfaced in China late in 2019, not only were masks on hand, they were also a familiar tool for fighting a virus: Many people had used them during the SARS outbreak in 2003. Based on this experience as well as government advice, masks quickly became even more widely used, not only in China, but in other East Asian countries.  ","1620204672","11"
"425","In contrast, the US, which had little experience with mask-wearing, took a wait-and-see approach. For more than five weeks after community spread was first documented in the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) deemed public mask-wearing unnecessary. In early April, it finally reversed its position and advised the public to wear cloth masks in public spaces. ","1620204672","11"
"426","But some experts saw the delay as a mistake even then, arguing that the case for cloth masks — based on evidence from before the pandemic — was strong enough for the CDC to recommend their use earlier.","1620204672","11"
"427","Now, new research suggests that East Asian countries’ early adoption of masks has played a role in their ability to control the transmission of Covid-19 — and the US government’s hesitation may have cost lives. “If we had masked up sooner, I think we could have prevented a lot of these infections,” says Shan Soe-Lin, a global health specialist at Yale University, who called for universal masking in a March Boston Globe op-ed co-written with Yale epidemiologist Robert Hecht.","1620204672","11"
"428","The change in CDC guidance led to a jump in mask-wearing in April, and a recent HuffPost/YouGov poll found that two-thirds of American say they always or mostly wear a face mask or other covering when they were near other people in public.","1620204672","11"
"429","With the nation now reopening, many experts are pointing to a growing body of scientific evidence, including a perspective published Wednesday in the journal Science, supporting universal mask-wearing in health care settings, airplanes, restaurants, and other crowded places with poor ventilation. And based on this evidence, more experts are arguing that more state and local governments should mandate cloth masks in these places to check the spread of the coronavirus (15 states require them so far).","1620204672","11"
"430","It’s a remarkable shift for the US to move toward mandatory masks in the span of just a couple months; let’s walk through how we got here.","1620204672","11"
"431","When the first case of person-to-person transmission was reported in the US on January 30, the CDC said it didn’t recommend the public use of face masks. US officials were focused on securing masks for health care workers. But in the process, they made contradictory and premature statements that masks were not effective for the public.  ","1620204672","11"
"432","On February 27, CDC director Robert Redfield said, “There is no role for these masks in the community,” adding, “These masks need to be prioritized for health care professionals that as part of their job are taking care of individuals.”","1620204672","11"
"433","In a February 29 tweet, US Surgeon General Jerome Adams further downplayed the utility of masks for the public:","1620204672","11"
"434","While officials’ concern that the public would hoard medical masks was warranted given the limited supply, completely dismissing public mask-wearing went against existing pandemic recommendations and scientific studies. In October, the World Health Organization (WHO) published guidelines for a potential influenza pandemic, which would spread through respiratory droplets like the coronavirus. ","1620204672","11"
"435","The WHO guidance reads: “Face masks worn by asymptomatic people are conditionally recommended in severe epidemics or pandemics, to reduce transmission in the community.” ","1620204672","11"
"436","Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong who co-authored the WHO evidence review, says, in a serious pandemic, “countries should definitely throw everything they’ve got, including face masks.” But at the time, the US was too fixated on hoarding to recognize the potential benefits of recommending cloth masks.","1620204672","11"
"437","Eventually, as cases mounted, the US came to embrace that approach and settled on a solution that wouldn’t threaten the personal protective equipment stockpile. On April 3, the CDC recommended that the general public wear cloth masks, rather than medical-grade masks — N95 respirator masks, which filter a higher percentage or particles, and surgical masks. ","1620204672","11"
"438","Explaining why it shifted the guidance, the CDC cited new research showing asymptomatic people can transmit the virus. However, Soe-Lin of Yale University says the evidence of asymptomatic transmission was already clear enough for the US to recommend mask-wearing much earlier in the pandemic. ","1620204672","11"
"439","In the wake of shifting guidance, at least 15 states now require cloth masks in public places. But the practice is still far from universal, with some businesses now refusing to serve customers who do wear a mask, according to the Washington Post.","1620204672","11"
"440","Some academics have argued that US culture has continued to be a barrier. Heather Akou, a fashion historian at Indiana University who has researched the politics of face-covering, says, “Unfortunately in the West, we tend to really associate masks with people doing things for nefarious purposes,” rather than as a symbol of health. “I definitely think people see face-covering as something other people do.” ","1620204672","11"
"441","For some Americans who have worn masks, racial profiling has been exacerbated. Asian Americans have reported being harassed for wearing masks and black men have been targeted by the police while wearing them. ","1620204672","11"
"442","The White House has not helped to shift culture. Both President Trump and Vice President Pence have flouted mask recommendations during public appearances over the past few weeks. When the CDC announced the change in guidance, President Trump said, “You can do it. You don’t have to do it. I am choosing not to do it.” He added, “Somehow, I don’t see it for myself.” ","1620204672","11"
"443","Trump’s resistance to masks may be more about optics than anything else, but the use of cloth masks has stoked debate, not just about their efficacy, but also about how high the bar for scientific evidence should be during a pandemic. Was enough known about the costs and benefits of recommending public cloth mask-wearing for the CDC to do it earlier in the pandemic? ","1620204672","11"
"444","Scientific studies have evaluated surgical and N95 masks, but relatively few have looked at whether cloth masks can stop virus transmission. Ideally, to gauge the efficacy of cloth masks in this pandemic, scientists would use a randomized control trial (RCT) to compare how much Covid-19 patients spread the virus with and without cloth masks. However, such a trial would take precious time and pose ethical problems.","1620204672","11"
"445","For the WHO influenza pandemic mask recommendation, researchers did not find statistically significant evidence from RCTs for the use of face masks, but from the broader literature, they concluded that masks could slightly reduce transmission, according to Cowling. ","1620204672","11"
"446","The lack of direct RCT evidence for Covid-19 mask-wearing shouldn’t stop countries from deploying them — including cloth masks while medical mask supplies remain constrained, Trish Greenhalgh, a primary health care expert at Oxford University, and her co-authors argue in the British Medical Journal. Indirect evidence suggests that masks have the potential to reduce Covid-19 transmission and — critically — they point out that the benefits probably outweigh the costs: Masks are cheap and the risks of using them are low.","1620204672","11"
"447","New research looking at surgical masks lends support to their use to prevent virus particles from an infected person from spreading into the air. An April Nature Medicine study of a sample of 10 people infected with a seasonal coronavirus found that people wearing surgical masks did not shed the virus in respiratory droplets or aerosols (smaller droplets), while 30-40 percent of infected people who weren’t wearing masks did shed the virus. The study also found that the surgical masks effectively blocked droplets containing the flu. “There’s no reason to think the masks would work differently for Covid-19,” says University of Hong Kong’s Cowling, who also authored this study.","1620204672","11"
"448","The effectiveness of cloth masks against this virus depends on how it is spread, which is still under investigation. According to the WHO, Covid-19 spreads primarily through droplets, which are released when someone sneezes, coughs, or talks. However, experts have also argued that Covid-19 is being spread through aerosols. ","1620204672","11"
"449","Cloth masks are most effective at filtering out larger droplets. For instance, a damp cloth almost entirely blocked droplets created by talking in an experiment described in an April New England Journal of Medicine letter to the editor. ","1620204672","11"
"450","Cloth masks work.Here's the proof  https://t.co/aBQb8Nzr8v@AnnalsofIMSeriously, a thoughtful explanation for why they're essential.by @CMClase and colleagues @McMasterU, capital of evidence-based medicine #Masks4All pic.twitter.com/MfVEkN9ATR","1620204672","11"
"451","Masks can also help filter out smaller aerosols, but to a lesser extent. Household materials, ranging from a scarf to a vacuum cleaner bag, had between a 48 percent and 86 percent filtration efficiency in a study looking at these smaller particles, compared to the 95 percent efficiency rate of N95 masks. A mask’s efficacy will depend, in part, on the material and shape, as well as how snugly it fits on your face and whether it’s covering both the nose and mouth. ","1620204672","11"
"452","“What I worry about is exposure to the smaller particles that are exhaled from talking and breathing and not coughing and sneezing,” says Lisa Brosseau, an environmental health specialist at the University of Illinois at Chicago who co-authored an article in April arguing there was not enough data to recommend that members of the general public without symptoms wear cloth or surgical masks. In an interview, she said she still doesn’t endorse the use of cloth masks because of concerns about how effective they are at blocking those particles. “I don’t have a problem with people wearing masks,” she says, “I tell them to be careful when you wear a mask that you don’t count on them.” ","1620204672","11"
"453","Some experts argue that everyone should have access to high-grade medical masks (N95s) if supplies are secured. But in the interim, many are encouraging the public to wear cloth masks as a symbol of collective action against the virus.","1620204672","11"
"454","“I wear it because it’s effective — it’s not 100 percent effective — but it’s ... respect for another person, and have that other person respect you,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Wednesday. “You wear a mask, they wear a mask, you protect each other.”","1620204672","11"
"455","In addition to scientific experiments in the lab, growing evidence from East Asian countries suggests that masks can reduce the transmission of Covid-19. From Hong Kong to Taiwan, many East Asian governments started promoting mask-wearing soon after the Covid-19 outbreak began.  ","1620204672","11"
"456","In contrast to the US, a preexisting culture of wearing masks helped spark rapid mask adoption, in part due to the lasting legacy of SARS. In Hong Kong, for example, “People voluntarily did it rather than people waiting for any government recommendations,” says Chi Chiu Leung, a doctor and former Hong Kong public health official who has advocated for universal mask-wearing during the pandemic. ","1620204672","11"
"457","But the adoption of masks was not entirely straightforward. ","1620204672","11"
"458","The Hong Kong Department of Health recommended the public use surgical masks on January 24 but the government’s ban on face masks, introduced last year during the city’s protests, still held. Hongkongers started wearing surgical and cloth masks despite — or in some cases because of — the ban, according to Cowling. In the city, 97.5 percent of respondents said they were wearing masks when surveyed in mid-February.","1620204672","11"
"459","Similarly, in Japan, while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was criticized for a delayed response to the pandemic, some experts credit Japan’s high standards for personal hygiene, including mask-wearing, with helping to bring the virus under control in recent weeks.","1620204672","11"
"460","Concerns about SARS, the avian flu in 2004, and then the swine flu in 2009 heightened the popularity of masks in Japan, according to a 2012 study published in The Sociology of Health and Illness. Wearing masks became  a “risk ritual” in the country, write the study’s authors.","1620204672","11"
"461","“When we deal with illness or the threat of illness, we use scientific knowledge, but it’s not everything,” says Mitsutoshi Horii, a sociologist at Chaucer College in the UK who co-authored the study. “In Japan, masks actually function in many different ways. Fundamentally, wearing a mask gives people a sense of security — being in control.” ","1620204672","11"
"462","In China, Covid-19 mask-wearing was instinctual to a certain extent as well, but strong government policies also helped to reinforce the public response. Wuhan required the use of masks in public spaces from hotels to parks starting January 22 — a day before the city’s lockdown. One nationwide survey conducted right after the Wuhan lockdown began showed that 98 percent of respondents (half of whom lived in Hubei province, home to Wuhan) were wearing masks when going out. ","1620204672","11"
"463","On January 30, China’s National Health Commission released Covid-19 protection guidelines that called for wearing single-use medical masks in public spaces. The government clearly stated that higher grade medical masks should be left for the use of health care workers. ","1620204672","11"
"464","While China faced mask shortages early on in the pandemic, rather than dismissing masks like the US initially did, the government quickly ramped up production to meet domestic demand. ","1620204672","11"
"465","Even though all of the formerly high-risk areas in China have been downgraded to low-risk, the national government continues to advise people to wear masks when they can’t maintain social distance. Beijing still requires mask-wearing in crowded places like subways and supermarkets.","1620204672","11"
"466","Some Chinese officials have been vocal in their view that mask-wearing has aided China’s containment of the virus. George Gao, the director-general of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told Science on March 27, “The big mistake in the US and Europe, in my opinion, is that people aren’t wearing masks.” ","1620204672","11"
"467","Other East Asian countries, including South Korea and Taiwan, also very quickly took to masks and have largely contained the coronavirus. A new study, posted on April 10 and still awaiting peer review, suggests this is no coincidence.","1620204672","11"
"468","The preliminary study, conducted by a team of researchers in Hong Kong and Europe, shows that 12 regions with a preexisting mask culture or Covid-19 mask guidance were all able to limit the spread of the virus and bring cases down more than 60 percent from peak levels. In contrast, regions that didn’t have mask guidance have not been able to achieve those markers of containment. It is too soon to say how significant the role of masks has been, says De Kai, a computer scientist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology who co-authored the study, but the correlation is very clear. ","1620204672","11"
"469","As the US reopens, advocates for masking say everyone should be required to wear them in public spaces to fight the coronavirus. Their reasoning? The virus can be spread asymptomatically, masks decrease transmission, and not enough people are wearing them yet.","1620204672","11"
"470","Among the advocates is a group of over 100 health experts who signed a May 14 letter and launched the #Masks4All movement calling for governments worldwide to mandate masks for the general public. Several countries and US states are responding; the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Austria now have masks requirements, and on Friday, Virginia became the latest state to do so.","1620204672","11"
"471","Two models in the preprint by De Kai and his co-authors show why requiring masks may make a difference. Assuming the use of a non-medical, but high quality mask, they found that if 80 percent of a population wears masks when lockdowns end, along with social distancing, the virus could be eliminated. This scenario would result in 60,000 deaths in a population the size of the UK (66.7 million). If only 50 percent of the population wears masks, cases would be reduced but the virus would continue to spread, leading to 240,000 deaths. ","1620204672","11"
"472","The study also demonstrates that masks are most useful if a country achieves a high level of mask-wearing by day 50 of an outbreak. Some US states have yet to reach that point. ","1620204672","11"
"473","“The expected utility of masks far outweighs the cost,” De Kai says. “Even if the uncertainty was 50-50, which it’s not,” he adds, “when it’s all upside and no downside, you take the bet.”","1620204672","11"
"474","In order to reach near universal levels of mask-wearing, though, the US may have to require masks rather than just advising their use. “We need 70 or 80 percent compliance to stop the spread especially with the lockdown phasing out,” says Jerome Howard, a data scientist at the University of San Francisco who co-authored an evidence review, “so the current approach [of most states] of just urging people to wear masks is definitely not working.” ","1620204672","11"
"475","On May 27, three University of Pennsylvania professors described in a New York Times op-ed why complementary policies and messaging are also needed to make mask-wearing easy, understood, and normal in the US. “The most obvious path to universal masking is to pass laws and punish infractions,” the Penn researchers write. “But enforcing legal edicts to wear masks in public can be difficult and costly, and amid widespread ambivalence can lead to backlash and even violence. So edicts are not a complete solution.”","1620204672","11"
"476","As the case for universal masking has strengthened, Cowling emphasizes that masks should be a part of a broader approach to controlling the virus. According to a recent observational study of Hong Kong’s Covid-19 response that he co-authored, near-universal masking is one of several measures — including quarantine, border restrictions, and distancing — that have likely helped reduce transmission. “From our analyses in Hong Kong, it looks like face masks can help but aren’t enough on their own to keep transmission down to a low level,” says Cowling.  ","1620204672","11"
"477","“I think it’s important that we don’t give the impression that people can rely on face masks to keep them safe,” he says. “Masks are useful but they are not a magic bullet against coronavirus.”","1620204672","11"
"478","The study “suffers from enough statistical bias to mask a beneficial effect of the drug,” public health researcher Zoe McLaren argued. In other words, omitting just a couple of confounding variables would be enough to change the results entirely.","1620284841","11"
"479","Making matters worse is President Trump, who will hold his first campaign rally in months in Tulsa. Initially, the rally was scheduled to be held on June 19, or Juneteenth, a day that’s typically a celebration of black liberation in America. The campaign insisted the decision to hold the rally on that site on that day was a coincidence. Eventually, the rally was moved to June 20. Some local health experts and city leaders have expressed concern about a 20,000-person rally being held during the Covid-19 pandemic, and a local newspaper has asked the president not to come. But the campaign appears determined to forge ahead. It will ask attendees to sign a waiver acknowledging the risk and will provide supporters masks and hand sanitizer, though it won’t require they be used.","1621763244","11"
"480","“Before COVID-19, America’s virus was racism,” Rev. Robert Turner told demonstrators at a protest in Tulsa in May, according to Tulsa World. “We are sick and tired of this disease. We demand a vaccine. Social distancing can’t kill racism. A face mask can’t kill racism. Nothing but the truth can cure it.”","1621763244","11"
"481","The good news, according to epidemiologists and doctors, is that there are many ways (besides wearing a mask) to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus or being infected in the streets while exercising the right to protest. The risk will not be zero, but protesters can minimize harm to themselves and others. So what should you bring to a protest?","1621763236","11"

"483","By hiding from protesters, Trump is also going against the macho persona he’s cultivated during his coronavirus response.

"486","If you look at the video coverage of what’s happening across the country, this is a multiethnic, multicultural protest in many ways, again, triggered by a specific instance of police brutality, but an instance that was the bookend to other cases of police brutality in the last few weeks and months, going back to Ahmaud Arbery in Atlanta to Breonna Taylor in Louisville. That’s just the tip of the iceberg. There’s more beneath the surface of the water prompting people to risk their lives, quite literally, in the midst of a pandemic and to protest without proper social distancing, in some cases without a mask, because they’ve been driven to the edge. ","1623498580","11"
"487","There’s also a time lag between exposures and detected cases since it can take weeks for infected people to show symptoms, so two weeks of falling Covid-19 cases could mask an infection spike in the background.","1624000827","11"
"488","However, until there’s a vaccine, cure, or widespread immunity, Covid-19 still poses a threat. That means precautions still have to be in place to control the spread of the virus, even as cases decline. People will still have to wear masks. Venues can’t get too crowded. Businesses will run at a diminished capacity. Gatherings will remain small and distant. ","1624000827","11"
"489","And limiting the spread of the virus can boost the effectiveness of a vaccine across a population, even if the vaccine itself doesn’t grant robust, long-term immunity to an individual. For instance, a vaccine that protects older people, coupled with social distancing and mask-wearing, would do more to slow the pandemic than any of these methods on their own. So a vaccine is ultimately one tactic in a suite of methods to control Covid-19. ","1624263151","11"
"490","For HIV, the lack of a vaccine to date has led public health officials to focus on treatments like antiviral drugs and to encourage less risky behavior, like using condoms. These tactics have improved the survival rate for people with the virus and reduced its spread. Similar attention to treatment and behavior could mitigate the harms of Covid-19, but it may require lasting cultural changes like wearing masks and avoiding large gatherings. ","1624263151","11"
"491","Similarly, Trump was clearly reluctant to mobilize the military to produce necessary personal protective equipment for health care workers battling the pandemic but seemed only too willing to mobilize the military to suppress protests. Much of the pushback against the very idea of wearing a mask when leaving your house to slow the spread of Covid-19 has been centered on the idea of being unable to breathe, yet George Floyd, like so many black people before him, was killed when a police officer placed a knee on his neck, cutting off his airway. Shortly after the president’s Monday photo op, Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson insisted during his nightly program — a favorite of Trump’s — that the American left wants to overthrow the government and rule by brute force; he made that statement barely an hour after Trump himself said he wanted to break historical precedent for use of the American military and, well, rule the country by brute force.","1624293191","11"
"492","The answer is, you probably don’t need to freak out about it. As long as you’re maintaining at least 6 feet of distance from other people and you’re not in a high-risk group, you’re engaged in a very low-risk activity, particularly if you and others are wearing masks.","1624377759","11"
"493","This is a pretty arduous sequence to execute properly, and it’s even more difficult for the virus if everyone involved — say, both you and the runner in front of you — is wearing a mask. You can see why, if you’re standing outdoors several feet away from an infected person, the virus might have a hard time making its way over to you at a high enough dose to actually infect you.  ","1624377759","11"
"494","Obviously, you don’t want to walk through someone’s fresh sneeze or cough cloud, and if this accidentally happens you should go home, change, and shower. But if you’re worrying about how many particles a passerby is generating with their exhalations, it may help to know that a study managed to quantify how many virus particles were detectable after patients who had Covid-19 and who were not wearing masks coughed five times into a petri dish at a distance of roughly 8 inches. ","1624377759","11"
"495","None of this is to say you should be cavalier when you venture into the outside world. Washing your hands, avoiding touching your face, being diligent about physical distancing, wearing masks in public, and disinfecting communal surfaces — all these things likely reduce transmission risk, and we should keep doing them, Rasmussen said. But she also said she feels fine about taking a walk with her husband outdoors. ","1624377759","11"
"496","Psychologically, different people have different levels of tolerance for risk. For some people, any risk that can be minimized, should be, no matter how small. For others, the recommended 6-foot distance, with masks, and the known decay of both the amount and the infectiousness of the virus — that’s good enough. ","1624377759","11"
"497","“Sure, you could slip, fall, strike your head, and die on that path in the park. Likewise, you could free-solo successfully to the top of El Capitan. But most of us would accept the risk of the stroll and not accept [the risk of] dangling from the cliff,” she said. “Breathing in someone’s sneeze cloud, close by, without a mask — that’s the cliff face. Jogging several feet away, or getting the mail — that’s the park.”  ","1624377759","11"
"498","Trump could have tried to rectify the situation by invoking the Defense Production Act, a Korean War-era law that allows the president to compel industry to make needed equipment for a national security emergency. In the coronavirus case, he could require major companies with large factories to make masks, gowns, ventilators, hospital beds, and more.","1624480011","11"

"504","The rescue shelter had an extremely wonderful setup for anyone hoping to choose the best possible cat for them: I’d pick out eight of the available cats on its website and would get the chance to meet them all inside an adoption van. The following evening, I put on a face mask and met Luis (not his real name) in his driveway. I was at the home of a stranger, alone, at 9 pm, 20 minutes away from my apartment or anyone I knew, but it was the most exciting place I’d ever been. My cat was in here!","1625757532","11"
"505","Aside from that, experts said other factors could play a role. Maybe people are staying home even though the shelter-in-place order is over. Perhaps masks and other practices people have adopted as a result of the pandemic, like washing our hands more thoroughly, are playing a big role in driving down transmission even as people go out more. It’s possible the warmer weather could help — or there could be some other factor we don’t know about, even just luck, that could play a driving role.","1625845195","11"
"506","Besides staying at home, other behavioral changes could be putting a dent in Covid-19 spread as well. Compared to just several months ago, Americans are more likely to wash their hands, avoid touching their faces, wear a mask, and keep at least 6 feet from each other. They’re also probably less likely to go out when they do feel sick.","1625845195","11"
"507","Consider masks. Just a few months ago, the idea that many Americans would go out with one was unthinkable. Today, polls show that the great majority of Americans are wearing masks sometimes if not always when they go out.","1625845195","11"
"508","The research on masks isn’t great, but there’s some suggestive evidence: As long as people actually wear the masks and use them properly, studies indicate that they have some effect in reducing disease transmission overall. Some experts hypothesize — and preliminary research suggests — that masks have played a significant role in containing Covid-19 outbreaks in several Asian countries where their use is widespread, like South Korea and Japan.","1625845195","11"
"509","Experts say they wouldn’t be surprised if masks play a bigger role than previously expected. As we’ve learned more about the coronavirus, we’ve gotten more and more evidence that it spreads through respiratory droplets. A mask quite literally stops those respiratory droplets.","1625845195","11"
"510","Whether it’s masks or something else, a large beneficial effect from behavioral changes while going out would be very good news. It would suggest that it’s safe to ease at least some social distancing as long as people follow certain practices. That might let Americans go out and about more — and stay safe — even without strict shelter-in-place orders in effect.","1625845195","11"
"511","There are things places can do to mitigate these events — stop flights, discourage travel, prohibit large gatherings, encourage good hygiene and mask use, and so on. But chaos can play a major role. “There’s absolutely an element of chance and a lot of uncertainty about what’s going to happen in every single community and every single country,” Meyers said.","1625845195","11"
"512","Plus, the rules change all the time. At one point you could be publicly shamed for wearing a mask because you were supposed to be saving them for nurses. A few weeks later you could be publicly shamed for not wearing one. If you’re in Missouri right now, you’re technically allowed to go to a concert. In New York, if you decide to sunbathe in a public park, there’s a good chance you’ll end up in a viral tweet about being a selfish rule-breaker.","1626287754","11"
"513","Maybe you can also empathize with the desire to scold others because you saw your friend’s little sister posting about taking a 10-person ski trip on her Instagram Story and that seems terribly irresponsible. Maybe you dislike this part of yourself because you’d rather people mind their business, because when you want to pull your mask down on an empty sidewalk to take in the scent of flowers and new leaves and air that has not been stagnant inside your apartment for weeks, you can never quite shake the worry that someone might scream at you to “GO HOME!”","1626287754","11"
"514","Beyond the fact that public shaming doesn’t often work as intended, Hieronymi cites an unusual source: Judith Martin, the etiquette expert better known as Miss Manners. “One of her basic maxims is to presume the best of the other person,” she says. “Presume they don’t have the right information, presume that they didn’t mean any harm, and then interact on that basis — even if you don’t necessarily have great evidence to the effect that they don’t have the right information. Following that advice, it would be, ‘Hey, did you know that masks can protect people and not wearing them will put me and others at risk?’ and personalizing it that way.”","1626287754","11"
"515","Meanwhile, police officers are systematically and violently arresting people of color for allegedly breaking social distancing guidelines, while those same forces politely hand out masks to large groups of white people. That’s on top of the fact that the coronavirus is killing black and Hispanic people at disproportionately high rates, in part because they’re more likely to be the same people for whom social distancing is a privilege, but also due to America’s longstanding economic and health care racial divides. Partly because of that history, these are not the people who are allowed to yell at strangers in public without consequences.","1626287754","11"
"516","Of course you should be wearing a mask, reducing trips to the grocery store, and social distancing whenever you can. As more states begin to reopen, however, the rules will continue to change and people will continue to be confused and scared and judgmental. More people will get sick and more people will die, more jobs will be lost, and more leaders will blame it all on our individual selfishness rather than their inaction. There has never been a better time to be a scold, but we have so many better things to do with our anger.","1626287754","11"
"517","Funeral processions — led by grieving families and a brass band and followed by the “second line” of mourners — are key to New Orleans’s distinctive African American culture, which includes the city’s musicians, bone men, social aid and pleasure clubs, baby dolls, and black masking Indians, sometimes called Mardi Gras Indians. ","1626708440","11"

"519","But when shortages of medical protective equipment were making the news, it wasn’t clear that funeral homes would be prioritized. So embalmers Stephanie Simon from Charbonnet Family Services and Duplain Rhodes from Rhodes scrambled to upgrade their equipment from the typical physician’s scrubs, paper aprons, and plastic gloves. They went to Home Depot and picked up dozens of white hooded Tyvek painters coveralls, which they now wear every time they go into the prep room, along with heavy-duty respirators or N95 masks and plastic face shields.","1626708440","11"
"520","In April, Carol “Kit” Harris, 61, and a few other “baby dolls” — an African American masking tradition where women dress in satin dresses and bloomers — had a brainstorm.

"521","One sister made everyone matching medical masks. The siblings also divvied up the 20 seats — 10 for each woman — within the small chapel. While funeral audiences are often gray-haired, the audience for the double funeral was not. That was partly because none of the remaining siblings of Mary Harris could risk possible exposure to the virus. Though it pained them, they stayed home and watched the ceremony streamed on Facebook Live.","1626708440","11"
"522","These feelings of collective uncertainty, powerlessness, and negativity likely account for the popularity of Covid-related conspiracy theories circulating online. Perhaps you’ve seen folks on social media claiming that Bill Gates is responsible for the coronavirus (he is not), or that 5G towers are somehow amplifying the virus (they are not), or maybe your friends or family have shared pieces of the propagandistic “Plandemic” documentary in which discredited biologist Dr. Judy Mikovits advances several false claims — including the notion that wearing a mask “literally activates your own virus” (it does not).","1626816395","11"
"523","Today, when I look at social media, sure, I see a few people sharing Covid-19 conspiracy theories, but what I see more of is people creating feelings of control and peace in more functional ways: sewing masks, helping neighbors get food, scheduling Zoom happy hours, gardening, and expressing gratitude for health care workers. These actions signal a healthier approach to chaos and trauma — not one anchored in either anger or fear but rooted in presence and gratitude, and echoing a profound tolerance for ambiguity.

"525","Let’s repeat that point: When you use a public bathroom, the best thing someone can do is wash their hands thoroughly. Vox explains how best to do that. You should also avoid touching your face and try to keep your mask on. ","1626859726","11"
"526","Don’t freak out. There is some evidence that the novel coronavirus can be found in poop, though the CDC says that it’s not clear that the virus has actually spread to other humans in that way. Even if it’s possible, the odds of actually catching the novel coronavirus through poop are likely extremely low. (Again, the best precautions a person can take are wearing a mask, not touching their face, washing their hands, and keeping their distance from others.)","1626859726","11"
"527","Another challenge is while counties and states continue to open up, increased sanitation duties will inevitably fall on the workers of those establishments. For instance, in its guide to reopening its locations, McDonald’s has directed its franchisees to clean bathrooms every half hour in its restaurants. In order to clean bathrooms safely, Feigl-Ding says those workers should have access to tons of personal protective equipment, including protective goggles and N95 masks. Some McDonald’s workers say the company isn’t doing enough.","1626859726","11"

"529","Over and over again, this idea of order is used to justify lawlessness on behalf of the state. The people advocating for that approach hide behind the fact that, for many people, it doesn’t look like lawlessness as long as the state is doing it. It doesn’t appear the same way as an anarchist in a black face mask throwing a brick. But when you look at those videos of cops just casually turning rubber bullets on people who are filming them, who are posing no threat to them — that’s just a crime.","1626898130","11"

"531","The people who were at the right-wing anti-lockdown protests were considered part of the public, they were neighbors. The police showed up without riot gear, just their little cloth masks. Then you look at the police who are massing in front of these protests in riot and SWAT gear and it sends a different message. ","1626898130","11"
"532","The World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday announced changes to its guidelines on who should wear a mask during the Covid-19 pandemic and where they should wear it. ","1627738370","11"
"533","The new guidance recommends that the general public wear cloth masks made from at least three layers of fabric “on public transport, in shops, or in other confined or crowded environments.” It also says people over 60 or with preexisting conditions should wear medical masks in areas where there’s community transmission of the coronavirus and physical distancing is impossible, and that all workers in clinical settings should wear medical masks in areas with widespread transmission.","1627738370","11"
"534","It’s a major update to the agency’s April 6 recommendations, which said members of the general public “only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with Covid-19” or “if you are coughing or sneezing.” And it’s important advice for countries around the world battling the virus, especially those in South America, the Middle East, and Africa, where the rate of Covid-19 transmission appears to be accelerating.","1627738370","11"
"535","At a WHO press conference on June 3, Michael Ryan, an infectious disease epidemiologist and the executive director of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, said WHO still believes that masks should primarily be used “for purposes of source control — in other words, for people who may be infectious, reducing the chances that they will infect someone else.” ","1627738370","11"
"536","But the changes finally bring the WHO in line with many countries around the world that have made masks mandatory in crowded public spaces, including Cuba, France, Cameroon, Vietnam, Slovakia, and Honduras. While it has not made masks a requirement, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has since April 3 suggested “wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.” ","1627738370","11"
"537","Many health experts have wondered why it’s taken this long for the WHO to update its mask guidelines, given the accumulation of evidence that they may be helpful and have few downsides. ","1627738370","11"
"538","Eric Topol, a research methods expert and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, calls WHO’s delay “preposterous.” He adds, “I have great respect for the World Health Organization — but they got the mask story all wrong, and we have lost people because of it.” Lawrence Gostin, director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, agrees, saying, “Everyone should be wearing a mask.” ","1627738370","11"
"539","But there have been a number of recent studies that experts point to as the best evidence for mask use in the general public to reduce Covid-19 transmission. And a growing number of doctors, scientists, and public health experts have been calling for universal masking in indoor public spaces and crowded outdoor spaces.","1627738370","11"
"540","One meta-review published in Lancet waded through 172 studies on Covid-19, SARS, and MERS, from 16 countries and six continents. Its authors determined that masks — as well as physical distancing and eye protection — helped protect against Covid-19. ","1627738370","11"
"541","The studies reviewed evidence both in health care and non-health care settings and then adjusted the data so they could be directly compared. The researchers found that your risk of infection when wearing a mask was 14 percent less than if you weren’t wearing a mask, although N95 masks “might be associated with a larger reduction in risk” than surgical or cloth masks.","1627738370","11"
"542","Other literature reviews have not been as favorable. Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, coauthored one such preprint review in early April. “In evidence-based medicine, randomized-controlled trials are supposed to trump observational studies,” he says, “And randomized-controlled trials have all been pretty much negative on face masks in the community.” The Lancet piece, he notes, gives more consideration to observational studies with surgical masks. ","1627738370","11"
"543","A few recent observational studies on mask use by the public in this pandemic, however,  support general mask usage to prevent the spread of Covid-19. One from Hong Kong concluded, “mass masking in the community is one of the key measures that controls transmission during the outbreak in Hong Kong and China.” Another concluded that if 80 percent of a population were to wear masks, the number of Covid-19 infections would drop by one-twelfth, or about 8.3 percent, based on observations from several Asian countries where mask-wearing is common. ","1627738370","11"
"544","There’s been some debate over the efficacy of homemade cloth masks and surgical masks (especially compared to N95 masks, which have more evidence behind them) for the general public. But one recent article, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found that even cloth masks block some viral particles from escaping.","1627738370","11"
"545","The general consensus is that masks are better at keeping your viral particles from spreading to others than keeping someone else’s from spreading to you. Catherine Clase, the lead author of the Annals of Internal Medicine piece and an associate professor of medicine at McMaster University, says one study she reviewed found even a single layer of cotton tea towel tested against a virus aerosol reduced transmission of the virus by 72 percent. “One thing to remember,” she says, “is that a mask doesn’t need to be perfect” to bring down the average number of people being infected by one sick person. “It just has to reduce the probability of transmission to some degree.” ","1627738370","11"
"546","William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, notes that previous data on masks and viruses came out of the SARS and MERS epidemics, which involved viruses that weren’t as transmissible. “Masks were thought of then as more personal protection as opposed to community protection,” he said, helping explain why masks weren’t widely regarded as particularly effective.","1627738370","11"
"547","But with Covid-19, the rate of asymptomatic patients may be as high as 40 percent, requiring a shift in thinking about masks from protecting the wearer to protecting the community. Clase concludes that while cloth masks may not protect you from inhaling someone else’s germs, “the evidence that they reduce contamination [from sick people] of air and surfaces is convincing, and should suffice to inform policy decisions on their use in this pandemic.” ","1627738370","11"
"548","The WHO generally does rigorous reviews of evidence, as the whole world’s health rides on their recommendations. This may explain their delay in recommending the general public wear masks. ","1627738370","11"
"549","Greenhalgh argued in early April that it was time to apply the precautionary principle to pandemic response and that the public should wear masks “on the grounds that we have little to lose and potentially something to gain.” ","1627738370","11"
"550","STAG-IH was asked to look into the evidence for and against mask use in early May and compiled a report for the WHO that was made public on May 25. The finding “supports mask use by the general public in the community to decrease the risk of infection,” the WHO said in a statement to Vox, noting that in updating their guidance, they took the STAG-IH advice into consideration.","1627738370","11"
"551","Cliff Lane, the clinical director at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health and another member of STAG-IH, says the WHO is ”very good at trying to get a diverse set of opinions before making recommendations.” But he admits he doesn’t know why the WHO has timed its recommendations for masks the way it has.","1627738370","11"
"552","He is one of many experts Vox interviewed who said it’s difficult to conduct a randomized, double-blind controlled study of mask use in the general public. Because of ethics and practicality, “much of the epidemiologic data on the impact is inferred,” he says. This magnifies a general problem he sees: “Any guideline you make does an assessment of risk and benefit, and you want to get as much information as you can.” For example, if wearing a mask provides a sense of false security and encourages people to stop social distancing, then consequences may not be worth it. “It’s not a trivial decision,” he says.","1627738370","11"
"553","Topol, on the other hand, says the best reason he can think of for the WHO not recommending everyone wear masks is because of the worry over a global shortage of masks, particularly in the US. Perhaps, he says, “They didn’t want to have masks maldistributed, because of the dire need for, and lack of, PPE for health care personnel.” ","1627738370","11"
"554","But, he adds, “That’s not the reason to say you don’t need masks — that’s the reason to say we desperately need to make masks.”","1627738370","11"
"555","But the WHO isn’t alone in being slow to suggest mask use. Countries like Venezuela made masks mandatory on March 14, and the Czech Republic made the move on March 18. But the US CDC also originally recommended against masks for the public, only changing its guidance to universal masking on April 3. ","1627738370","11"
"556","Sometimes those changes are minor, and sometimes, as in the case of the CDC’s mask guidance, they are significant. “In order for that to make sense to the public, you need to have something that we’re lacking right now: direct communication,” Besser says. “That’s valuable because it engenders trust in settings of crisis, where there are things people should do to protect their health. They’re much more likely to do them if they trust the messenger.” ","1627738370","11"

"558","Many protesters are following public health advice while demonstrating: wearing masks, distancing, using hand sanitizer, and getting tested for Covid-19. But it also must be said that there’s no perfectly safe way to demonstrate in huge gatherings during a pandemic, and the threat of new waves of Covid-19 is still very real. ","1627738361","11"
"559","No one knows what’s going to happen next, or how big the next wave might be. There are so many unknowns about how the virus will spread in a country with a patchwork system of response and varying levels of adherence to social distancing and mask-wearing. ","1627738361","11"
"560","We also know mass gatherings are risky, even if people take precautions. Yes, it’s safer that the protests are outside (there are very few documented cases of outdoor coronavirus transmission). Yes, it’s safer when people wear masks; it’s safer when people try to distance themselves from one another. But there’s no such thing as zero risk with this virus. And the math of exponential growth means it doesn’t take a big spark to create an outbreak that numbers in the thousands. ","1627738361","11"
"561","If you believe the protests are essential, “then I would say your social priority is to do harm reduction,” Bateman-House says.

","1627738361","11"
"562","Another NYPD officer stationed in Brooklyn was also suspended without pay after pulling down a protester’s mask and pepper spraying him in the face on May 30. The incident was captured on video and shared to Twitter, where it’s received more than 3 million views so far. ","1627738346","11"

"564","On our daily walk, my small dog barked at a big dog, and I did what I always do: smile meaningfully, in a manner I hope communicates, “She’s friendly!” and, “I’m sorry!” and, “I don’t think that was an appropriate response, either!” but then I realized I was masked. How did the big dog’s companion feel about it? I couldn’t tell. He was also masked. I worried a woman with a poodle was mad at me for allowing my dog to sniff her dog. “You can see it in her eyes!” I told my boyfriend. “No,” he said. “You can’t.” ","1629105732","11"
"565","But we are going on three months. The streets sometimes have people in them. Masks still mean something is wrong, but now they’re also just a fact of living, and what was a siren has mellowed into a low unsettling hum. It is very hard to say anything definitive about what the next year or month or week will look like, but by all expert predictions, we can say this: It is almost certain that the future will be masked. ","1629105732","11"
"566","In the first days of the coronavirus pandemic, we were told masks weren’t necessary, maybe even counterproductive, despite the fact that they’d been common in Asia for years. Then a chorus of medical experts began raising alarm bells: Yes, of course we should wear masks, they argued, in the pages of the New York Times and the Washington Post and the Boston Globe. In early April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) amended its guidelines, recommending that people wear “cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.” In June, the World Health Organization stated that the public should wear masks “on public transport, in shops, or in other confined or crowded environments,” with medical masks preferred for people over age 60 or with preexisting conditions. ","1629105732","11"
"567","So now, with certain high-ranking exceptions and some public consternation, we’re wearing masks, and we will be wearing masks for the foreseeable future. As the economy opens up and we spend more time in public settings, it seems possible that we will only wear more masks, trading the freedom of exposing our full faces for the freedom of rejoining some semblance of the world. Office workers will wear masks. Commuters will wear masks. ","1629105732","11"
"568","Rationally, it should be a small change: Masks, for one thing, aren’t very big. There is a lot we still don’t know about how well masks work and under what circumstances, but there is mounting evidence that even non-medical grade fabric masks help prevent the coronavirus from spreading, which is logical: If the virus spreads mainly through infected droplets, then yes, let’s do our best to contain them before we cough or sneeze or talk them out into the world. So this is what we’re doing now, and if it helps at all, then it’s obviously worth it. I have never especially liked my chin, anyway.","1629105732","11"
"569","It isn’t just a feeling. It is, according to Paula Niedenthal, a psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin who studies emotional processing, simply true. We really do lose information when we’re operating without the benefit of the lower half of our face, she tells me from her home in Madison, where she has been experimenting with her own growing mask collection. Eyes may be the window to the soul, but mouths and chins, it turns out, are also quite useful.","1629105732","11"
"570","This does not affect all feelings equally. Fear and anger, for example, are big upper face emotions, Niedenthal says; a mask doesn’t change wide eyes or furrowed brows. But happiness and sadness — lower face emotions — are harder to read.","1629105732","11"
"571","Now, there are new ways to misunderstand each other, and we already had so many good ones before. Facial mimicry is a form of communication, she explains: You smirk at me, I smirk back, you see me mirroring your smirk, confirming that I saw you, and now we have reached an understanding. We are, together, smirking. “That’s what we can’t have with masks,” she says. “If I’m making a smile of dominance, and you’re thinking I’m being affiliative,” then “whatever you’re doing back to me is not what I’m doing to you,” and masks or no masks, “it’s going to be perceived as an error by both of us.”","1629105732","11"
"572","But here, mostly, there isn’t, and when we search each other’s faces now, we are often staring into each other’s masks.","1629105732","11"
"573","In 1910, a respiratory illness called the Manchurian Plague ravaged northeastern China. Most experts were pretty sure the disease was spread by rats, but Wu Lien-teh, the young doctor who’d been put in charge of China’s plague response, had another idea: The disease, he argued, was spread through droplets in the air. This, according to medical anthropologist Christos Lynteris, was “heresy,” but it was also right. In an attempt to keep the disease contained, Wu began turning existing surgical masks into “easy-to-wear protective devices,” mainly for doctors, nurses, and patients.","1629105732","11"
"574","People were skeptical, until a doctor who’d refused to wear one died. And then, as Lynteris tells it, people changed their minds. The masks — which look more or less like modern surgical masks — became symbols of modernity and reason, and good hygiene, proof that China was “trailblazing ahead of Western medicine.” (The dead doctor had been French.)","1629105732","11"
"575","It wasn’t until the first wave of the 1918 Spanish flu hit the US, though, that anti-epidemic masking went mainstream, explains Mitsutoshi Horii, a sociology professor at Japan’s Shumei University who is based in the UK. Regular people wore them. Health authorities mandated them. Protesters objected to them, citing their constitutional rights.","1629105732","11"
"576","And then, for reasons that are somewhat hard to pinpoint, the histories diverge. In the US, mask use fizzled out. In China, as in much of East Asia, masks remained.","1629105732","11"
"577","Horii, who studies mask use in Japan specifically, says that their widespread acceptance in the country emerged — ironically — amid a major push to westernize Japan in the 1920s. The folk rituals people used to perform, the ones that allowed them some feeling of control over uncontrollable situations — outbreaks of disease, for example — were now banned. “People didn’t know what to do,” Horii says. “They had their own practices that they used to do, but now they’re not allowed to do it.” There was an opening. Masks were something they could do, a ritual of modern science.","1629105732","11"
"578","It’s not that everyone loved masks immediately: A common theme in medical mask history is that nobody anywhere loves medical masks. “So many people ridiculed mask-wearing in the beginning,” he says. They looked weird. They were a sign of weakness. Why did healthy people need to wear masks? But masks are actionable. “By putting on a mask,” he tells me, “people feel a sense of control over the situation.” And so for the next several decades, masks cycled in and out of favor in Japan, “always there, in the background,” mostly enlisted to help prevent the flu.","1629105732","11"
"579","And then came SARS, and with it the beginning of modern mask history. The epidemic, which was concentrated in East Asia in 2002 and 2003, “led to the massive adoption of face masks as personal anti-viral protection” in the region, writes Lynteris. Before SARS, anthropologist Judy Yuen-man Siu told the Atlantic, masks were uncommon in Hong Kong, where she is based; now, she says, they’ve been “widely adopted,” both as a medical strategy and a social symbol. When the novel coronavirus broke out, there wasn’t even a question: Yes, masks, of course.","1629105732","11"
"580","In the US, many of us are still adapting to navigating public life without our chins, and one result of this is that masks have not yet matured into the fabric of American life. It has only been nine weeks since the CDC began advising Americans to wear them.","1629105732","11"
"581","If it has been an uphill battle to acclimate the country to our new masked life, there is a deep-seated reason for it. “In some countries, the moral significance of masks has been understood to be pro-social,” says Martha Lincoln, a medical anthropologist at San Francisco State University, pointing to China and Vietnam as examples. “Whereas in the US, I think we have a sense that wearing a mask is an anti-social gesture.” Masked figures tend to get read not as communitarian, but criminal. “A person wearing a mask may have a nefarious motive, may be an outlaw, may be a member of an anarchist black bloc,” she says. To subordinate your own identity doesn’t make you civically responsible; it means you’re hiding something.","1629105732","11"
"582","Or, at least, it used to. Now that is changing, but not everywhere, not evenly, and not all at once. As a result, masks themselves have become a form of communicative shorthand. There is, of course, the obvious: As masks have become a “flashpoint in the virus culture wars,” wearing one or not becomes a very visible indicator of what kind of person you think you are. They are a tangible acknowledgment that we are all living amid the same disaster, and we care, and we’re trying. But maybe they could do more?","1629105732","11"
"583","Clive Fields, a primary care physician and the chief medical officer at VillageMD in Houston, is optimistic that masks could maybe, in their own way, help bring people closer. “I had a plastic surgeon come down here literally an hour ago to show me his new University of Texas face mask,” he tells me. “All of a sudden, instead of being barriers, masks become initiators of conversation because you either have something in common or it’s a friendly common foe.” In the void where sports used to go, we can at least have sports-adjacent masks.","1629105732","11"
"584","He predicts a future where we’ll all have a small wardrobe of masks we wear for different things: a home mask, a work mask, a looser mask for running. “There’ll be expensive masks and cheap masks, and they’ll be used as status symbols and non-status symbols, and it’ll become part of the way we dress,” Field hypothesizes. “No one thought about the watch as a fashion statement or a status symbol or as a way to convey other types of information,” he says, and now look where we are.","1629105732","11"
"585","It is hard for me to imagine this future, where masks are as unremarkable as watches. But then, my conception of what is and is not imaginable is changing very quickly.","1629105732","11"
"586","When she’d first considered the possibility of a masked near-future, Deihl found the prospect grim. “But I’m evolving very rapidly on this. And why shouldn’t you have a nice one? A black one, if you want to wear a dark coat, or one that’s a little bit lighter weight in the summer,” she says. “I think it might become like sunglasses.”","1629105732","11"
"587","In the right light, says Chris Hosmer, whose company Airpop, was making slick, athletic-looking masks for the Chinese market well before the coronavirus crisis, sunglasses seem far-fetched, too. “If sunglasses didn’t exist today and you were going to pitch an investor on sunglasses, you would sound insane,” he told Rose Eveleth at Vox last year. “‘Hey, we’re gonna put this thing that covers, like, the window to your soul, the most communicative part of your body; we’re gonna put something in front of it so that you can’t see it, and that thing is gonna essentially be able to protect you from your environment.’ They would be like, ‘What? That’s stupid. No one’s gonna do that!’”","1629105732","11"
"588","That doesn’t mean designers aren’t trying. “I see it as the most important accessory of the coming year,” says Lia Kes, a New York City-based sustainable designer whose clothes I can’t afford, but whose masks I could. (Masks, like perfume and also sunglasses, are an entry-level item.) Like the rest of the fashion industry, she started making masks because people she knew needed masks. But now, she says, she can picture a place for masks in our post-pandemic future. “I haven’t completely figured out what it will look like a year from now, but this is my feeling,” she says. “Even after all this, I cannot imagine myself boarding a flight without a mask on.” And for all their many drawbacks, face coverings do afford some arguable benefits. They allow a certain relaxation of beauty standards, for example. They offer a sense of protection from the world, like headphones for your face.","1629105732","11"
"589","For example, have you considered masks?","1629105732","11"
"590","We are only just beginning our collective mask journey. It is a process of discovery. Of all possible garments, masks are singularly intimate, a cross between underwear and your actual face. “This is a moment not only for designers but for the textile industry,” says David. “What are the weave structures? Can we design new fabrics?” On the whole, masks are still hot and miserable, but what if they weren’t?","1629105732","11"
"591","“I’m still wearing the same mask I wore in medical school,” says Fields. “And literally, in three weeks, the nurses and the lay staff I work with figured out how to create masks that are more comfortable, and in all honesty, more fashionable.” There’s no reason to think the masks we have now are as good as masks could ever get. “I’ll bet if you have this conversation with somebody a year from now,” he tells me, “you’re going to hear things that you couldn’t even have imagined today.”","1629105732","11"
"592","Niedenthal, the affective psychologist, is skeptical there is a textile innovation so transformative that it could turn masks, a symbol of mass death, into sunglasses, a symbol of the beach. A mask “means there’s a problem,” she tells me. “It’s not going to be something we do when everything is fine.” ","1629105732","11"
"593","What is fine, though, after this? There will still be colds. Flu season will still come every year. I hope I never wear a mask again. I also picture all the droplets from the diagrams. “In general, there’s a lot of forgetting around epidemics, even when that seems absolutely impossible,” Lincoln tells me. Masks faded quickly after 1918; we could forget again.","1629105732","11"
"594","Deihl sees it playing out another way. We will normalize masks because we have to make reality more bearable. “Underlying so many things is this human need to — even when things are wrong — we want to put literally our best face on them,” she says. We want masks to mean something different, and so we’ll try to make them. “That’s why I think there’s going to be a transition,” and what was protective will become “a seasonal accessory.” ","1629105732","11"
"595","About 500 businesses have called a hotline set up by New York City’s Small Business Services to field reopening questions, according to city officials. The city is also offering support to businesses, such as providing face masks. ","1629287645","11"
"596","The mayor said 800 police school safety officers will be deployed to subway platforms to help encourage social distancing and hand out free face masks (there will be no criminal enforcement). Social distance markers have started to appear on subway platforms and at stations, designating areas for people to safely stand. ","1629287645","11"
"597","There is a large Arab population there, which has been mistrustful of the government and its public health restrictions. A mask shortage and a weak health system have added to the difficulty in containing the second wave.","1629287640","11"
"598","Carlisle dons colorful masks she picks up from a vendor across the street for her “Saturday Serenades,” belting out songs by Jeannie C. Riley, Lesley Gore, and Linda Ronstadt. “It’s the one excuse I have to put makeup on during the week,” she said with a laugh. “It started as a joke — at least when this whole thing is over with, I can take the mask off and sing without the mask.” ","1631076974","11"
"599","Public health experts in the state have blamed the relaxing of social distancing for the spread, as the Arizona Republic reported. Arizona began to reopen gyms, restaurants, and other businesses in mid-May. The state has not required all individuals to wear masks in public, but workers who interact with the public are expected to have a mask.","1631329067","11"
"600","The Raleigh News & Observer reported the state saw a record number of hospitalizations on Tuesday. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has sought to restore some social distancing in problematic places, such as ordering a racetrack that had been the site of an informal, maskless protest to close again.","1631329067","11"
"601","At the same time, certain activities — like high school sports — have been allowed to resume in recent days. The state is also not currently requiring masks to be worn in public places. Its trendlines are being watched closely for now; the top state health official recently said she was concerned about the specific benchmarks being monitored to determine whether schools will be reopened.","1631329067","11"
"602","Testing, again, does not seem sufficient to explain the trends, and health officials are clearly worried about people not taking proper precautions. No state mandate for mask-wearing is in effect, though people are being urged to wear one.","1631329067","11"
"603","State officials acknowledge that transmission is worrisomely persistent, and masks have been required or strongly recommended in public places since April. There does not appear to be any serious consideration of renewed social distancing policies for the time being.","1631329067","11"
"604","This is one of the states that never had a statewide stay-at-home order, and some business activities resumed in early May. The general public is not being required to wear masks, but employees at public-facing companies are.","1631329067","11"
"605","Florida was a little later in reopening than other states on this list, so it is difficult to be sure why spread seems to be picking up. Gov. Ron DeSantis pointed to groups of agriculture workers who live in close quarters as one possible explanation. He also blamed people for failing to wear masks as has been advised — but not mandated, except for workers — by the state.","1631329067","11"
"606","But that challenge can be addressed. “We’ve seen clear examples of how transmission appears to be controllable with widespread testing and physical distancing, including mask-wearing,” Cobey says. Look at South Korea, for example. “If most people on the planet could take those precautions, perhaps the virus would go away.”","1632144362","11"
"607","In the absence of test-and-trace deployments, we can all do our best to try to reduce our chances of spreading the coronavirus to others: by wearing masks, by maintaining distancing between people, by avoiding crowds indoors, among other suggestions to reduce harm while rejoining society in a limited capacity. ","1632144362","11"
"608","These new infections aren’t a surprise. Epidemiologists warned us that reopening too quickly could backfire. When we let up on precautions without putting new ones in place — like a national test, trace, and isolation effort and universal masking — the virus will find lots of new people to infect. The models told us this too: The places most at risk for a second wave are the places that largely avoided the first one (like Arizona), and didn’t prepare well for a second. These places have populations that are almost entirely susceptible to infection. Removing the most powerful thing protecting them — social distancing — without new precautions in place just leaves them exposed.","1632144362","11"
"609","This is why many protestors have arrived at these events masked, equipped with hand sanitizer, gloves, and sometimes extra personal protective equipment (PPE) for other protesters and even for on-duty police officers.","1633009748","11"
"610","FWIW I’ve noticed that protesters have done a much better job distributing masks and hand sanitizer in the past week than the government has in five months","1633009748","11"
"611","According to the online testimonies of on-the-ground protesters and reporters, many members of the police force at these protests don’t appear to be wearing masks. Masks are an optional accessory for most officers on protest duty, HuffPost’s Alexander Kaufman reported, and some police departments allow cops to wear face coverings at their own discretion. Still, so long as the coronavirus continues to be a public health threat, it remains a valid question — one that protesters have voiced after being in close confrontations with unmasked police: Why are officers able to dress up in riot gear but not put on masks? Why are civilians expected to vigilantly mask up when cops, whose job it is to enforce the law, aren’t expected to do the same?","1633009748","11"
"612","“Officers are encouraged to wear masks but it is voluntary, except in situations in which they are interacting with vulnerable populations or entering places where the Mayor’s order has required face coverings,” a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, DC, wrote to me in an email. And while the city of Chicago’s policy generally requires all on-duty personnel to wear department-issued surgical masks and gloves, a spokesperson said: “Given the heightened activity that officers have been responding to in the past week, there may be situations in which officers may not have masks and gloves on.” ","1633009748","11"
"613","New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio emphasized the need for officers to wear masks in public, saying at a press conference: “I know you have a hard job but, you know — do unto others. If we’re asking everyone else to follow the rules, social distancing, wear a face covering for the protection of all, you should do it too.”","1633009748","11"
"614","Most police departments probably have the financial capacity to fully equip officers with masks, Kaufman noted, in light of the national scrutiny toward growing city police budgets. However, HuffPost’s survey of the country’s 20 most-populous cities found that most police departments had “loose guidelines” and virtually no measures to penalize officers for not wearing masks.","1633009748","11"
"615","It doesn’t help that the US doesn’t have universal mask guidelines; instead, guidelines vary by state and locale, which can be confusing. Furthermore, the American medical community — and as a result the US — was late to encourage mask-wearing, in comparison to Asian countries like China, South Korea, and Japan. In February, for example, many experts consistently told me that masks weren’t necessary and that Americans shouldn’t hoard surgical or medical-grade masks, like the coveted N95, which should be reserved for front-line health care workers. Some experts started walking back those statements in mid- to late March, and by early April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had amended its guidelines to encourage the wearing of “cloth face coverings” in public settings where people could come into close contact with each other.","1633009748","11"
"616","Because there are no clear laws in place mandating masks in public, the decision to wear one ultimately falls on the individual. It’s a simple choice, one that should be made for the sake of public health and the collective good of others in the community. But given how the coronavirus — specifically how states and lawmakers have responded to it — has become so politicized, donning a mask can also be interpreted as a moral or political statement; in some right-wing circles, it’s seen as an overreaction to the severity of the pandemic. ","1633009748","11"
"617","Our future will likely be masked, as Rachel Sugar wrote for The Goods, although there are detractors who still refuse to wear masks in public (Exhibit A: President Donald Trump, who doesn’t “want to give the press the pleasure of seeing” him masked). On Twitter, Trump shared a tweet that mocked Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden for wearing a black mask in public, and some reports say that Trump believes masking up could ruin his presidential image. ","1633009748","11"
"618","While there are plenty of viral videos on social media of obstinate customers who refuse to put on a mask, this contrarian behavior actually runs counter to that of a majority of Americans, according to a survey conducted in early May by the Democracy Fund and the UCLA Nationscape project. About 85 percent of the 4,500 Americans surveyed, which includes Democrats, Republicans, and independents, have worn a mask in public. (About 89 percent of Democrats and 81 percent of Republicans said they’ve worn a mask to limit the spread of the coronavirus.) ","1633009748","11"
"619","As a result of these high-profile incidents, masks are seen as a symbolic shorthand for the partisan rift that has emerged from the coronavirus “culture wars.” In some cases, shop owners are refusing to serve those who do wear masks, the Washington Post reported. But as shocking as these isolated incidents might seem, the number of Americans who mask up (and the number of privately owned businesses that encourage mask-wearing) appears to outweigh those who don’t. ","1633009748","11"
"620","Yet entire police forces, even the New York City Police Department (which serves a city that is experiencing the worst of the coronavirus pandemic), are widely seen unmasked during patrols, while being expected to interact with civilians on a daily basis. When I sent an email asking the NYPD to clarify its mask policy, I received an email that provided no clear answers from department spokeswoman Sgt. Jessica McRorie: “Perhaps it was the heat. Perhaps it was the 15-hour tours, wearing bullet-resistant vests in the sun. Perhaps it was the helmets. With everything New York City has been through in the past two weeks and everything we are working towards together, we can put our energy to a better use.”","1633009748","11"
"621","There could be many reasons as to why police officers — a highly visible, organized group — are seemingly flouting these rules. Most police forces consist largely of men, and according to a Gallup poll conducted in mid-April, women are more likely to wear a mask outside of the home than men. A mask could be internalized as a sign of weakness and an affront to a person’s masculinity if they are seen wearing one, which could explain why Trump insists on avoiding cameras when masked. Men and women “absolutely” think differently about wearing masks, Catherine Sanderson, a psychology professor at Amherst College, told the New York Times. “Men speed more. Men engage in higher rates of binge drinking. Men are less likely to wear seatbelts.” For those in a high-risk profession like policing, the coronavirus might not seem to be as of an imminent threat as, say, rowdy protesters, which could make wearing masks less of a priority. ","1633009748","11"
"622","Regardless of the reason, these images of maskless police officers are only fueling the growing tide of anger and distrust toward law enforcement, adding to a narrative that officers don’t care about the health and safety of their own communities. It bolsters the perception that cops are above the law, or that they are able to interpret and apply the law however they wish. The optics of a maskless person can be jarring, serving as a stark reminder that the person is exempt from the rules that apply to the general public. ","1633009748","11"
"623","As masks become more normalized in the public sphere, especially as many states’ economies are expected to reopen, double standards for wearing them — among cops, civilians, and politicians alike — can put public health at risk. It is perhaps ironic, then, that some police officers, who operate as agents of the state, are refusing to comply with the guidance set forth by the authorities that lend their actions legitimacy. ","1633009748","11"
"624","Joe is one of millions of workers who takes his life into his hands as reopenings around the US mean people are returning to work. At the Target Starbucks where he works, the shifts can be harrowing. The store is crowded. Customers aren’t required to wear masks. The plexiglass sneeze guard only reaches up to his throat.","1633009730","11"
"625","“All the employees are doing a really good job at protecting ourselves, but the biggest issues are customers,” Joe says. Most customers won’t wear masks and often fail to stay 6 feet away, sometimes tapping him on the shoulder to get his attention. “It feels like I’m walking into a place that’s not safe for me.”","1633009730","11"
"626","A Target spokesperson pointed to an online hub outlining its social distancing and safety measures and said when associates express concerns, there are actions they can take — for example, increasing the frequency of store announcements about social distancing. Where local governments ask residents to wear masks, so does Target. But in places where that’s not the case, it does not. And so how safe workers are depends on what Target and its customers choose to do.","1633009730","11"
"627","She works in online pickups at the store, which has seen a huge rise in business, makes $15.30 an hour, and manages about 25 associates. Some of them have stopped coming into work, she’s not sure why, so that’s been extra stress. So has hurriedly trying to get shopping done for customers while wearing a mask. “It’s not easy to do aerobic exercise wearing face masks all day,” she said.","1633009730","11"
"628","Simply put, reopenings have led to more infections because more people are coming into contact with each other while there’s still a lot of virus around. Mask use is inconsistent, and even when they’re worn properly, masks are not 100 percent effective at preventing transmission.","1633305731","11"
"629","Similarly, Smith said she is “a bit surprised that Ohio is doing as well as we are since reopening.” Maskless armed protesters showed up at the Ohio Statehouse for three weeks to demand that the governor allow businesses to reopen. “We don’t have all the data right now to determine why some [areas] have increased and others have not,” she said. It could depend more on how individuals behave — for instance, whether they’re wearing masks — than on any broad policy the state may enact.","1633305731","11"
"630","At the protests, thousands of people congregated in close quarters and, though mask-wearing was common, it was not universal. Many public health experts lent their support to the protests, citing the toll taken on black Americans’ health across US history because of slavery and racism, but there seemed to be a real risk that these protests organized and attended by black activists would simply deepen the racial disparities in the coronavirus pandemic. Black Americans are already getting sick and dying from Covid-19 at higher rates than white Americans.","1633305729","11"
"631","The more people take precautions — wearing masks, washing hands, avoiding contact when possible — the more difficult it will be for the coronavirus to spread. But it should be clear by now: The pandemic is not over.","1633305729","11"
"632","“[The] best way that you can avoid — either acquiring or transmitting infection — is to avoid crowded places, to wear a mask whenever you’re outside,” Fauci said. “And if you can do both, avoid the congregation of people and do the mask, that’s great.” ","1634205935","11"
"633","The expert also suggested Americans should be in crowds only when there is no other choice: “If you’re going to be in a situation where, beyond your control there’s a lot of people around you, make sure you wear a mask,” Fauci added.","1634205935","11"
"634","Fauci’s advice followed the CDC’s release of new guidelines on Friday meant to help people manage exposure to the coronavirus as states reopen businesses and relax social distancing protocols across the nation. The guidelines note that taking part in group activities for extended periods of time around people who aren’t wearing masks or social distancing increases the risk of infection, and of spreading Covid-19.","1634205935","11"
"635","Epidemiologists have pointed out that chanting and shouting are among the activities most likely to increase the likelihood of transmission, particularly if people aren’t wearing masks. Trump himself has declined to wear a mask in public; in general, polls have shown Republicans are far less likely to wear masks in public than Democrats or independents. ","1634205935","11"
"636","The main way people are getting sick with SARS-CoV-2 is from respiratory droplets spreading between people in close quarters. Droplets fly from people’s mouths and noses when they breathe, talk, or sneeze. Other people can breathe them in. The dose matters: The more you breathe in, the more likely you are to get sick. That’s the main risk, and that’s why face masks are an essential precaution (they help stop the droplets from spewing far from a person’s mouth or nose).","1634205932","11"
"637","The CDC’s recommendations for individuals take this droplet spread into account, advocating for universal masking, enthusiastic hand-washing, keeping more than 6 feet away from other people, and limiting the amount of time you spend with others. Spending more time with people increases risks. (The CDC makes more specific recommendations for activities like dining out on its website.)   ","1634205932","11"
"638","A lot of the same principles apply in the CDC’s guidance for event planners. More people, more time, more crowds, and less mask-wearing result in a more dangerous situation. Plus, the CDC advises, “the higher the level of community transmission in the area that the gathering is being held, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spreading during a gathering.” ","1634205932","11"
"639","Scientists recognize that no activity with other people during a pandemic is perfectly safe. Even an activity with distancing, in a scenario with universal masking, that’s in an outdoor space, does not drop the risk to zero. Still, we need to find a middle ground, and reduce the harm that can result from our actions whenever possible. And these guidelines can help do that.","1634205932","11"
"640","When reporter BrieAnna Frank showed up to a Honeywell plant last week in Arizona to cover President Donald Trump’s visit, she was sure to wear a mask.","1653189669","11"
"641","But the dozen or so people who had gathered outside the facility to cheer on the president were not there to support masks. They had their faces uncovered, Frank told Vox.","1653189669","11"
"642","As she approached members of the crowd to interview them, the conversation quickly got heated. “They started to yell that me and the other journalists there were trying to incite fear and panic and paranoia” by wearing masks, said Frank, who works for the Arizona Republic.","1653189669","11"
"643","One man in particular seemed to take issue with the male journalists wearing masks, she recalled. “It’s submission, it’s muzzling yourself, it looks weak,” he said, “especially for men.”","1653189669","11"
"644","9:32 am - myself + other journalists here are being harassed for wearing masks. One man says: “It’s submission, it’s muzzling yourself, it looks weak - especially for men.”We’re being accused of fear-mongering, not knowing anything + being “pieces of shit.”  @azcentral","1653189669","11"
"645","They’re not alone. Trump himself declined to wear a mask while being photographed at the plant, though he claims he wore one “backstage.” Vice President Mike Pence was criticized for failing to wear a mask during a tour of the Mayo Clinic in April. And when armed protesters showed up at the Michigan statehouse on April 30 to protest stay-at-home orders amid the coronavirus pandemic, many were mask-free. One shouting, bare-faced man who was photographed at the rally later said he was “not at all” worried about the virus and would never wear a mask — “ever.”","1653189669","11"
"646","Since the pandemic began, the issue of wearing masks has further exposed America’s racial and gender prejudices. Earlier on, wearing masks was associated with Asian countries and often dismissed because of racist assumptions about those countries. Then, as many cities began to require residents to wear masks, police began targeting black men for covering their faces, profiling them as criminals rather than as people trying to abide by health guidelines. And for a certain subset of mostly white, conservative men, not wearing a mask seems to have become a hallmark of manliness.","1653189669","11"
"647","For unmasked protesters like the ones in Michigan, “There’s an assumption of a kind of invincibility that is tied to this idea of white masculinity,” Jonathan Metzl, a professor of sociology and psychiatry at Vanderbilt University and the author of Dying of Whiteness: How the Politics of Racial Resentment Is Killing America’s Heartland, told Vox.","1653189669","11"
"648","It’s not just men — Frank noticed many women among the unmasked Trump supporters gathered at the Honeywell plant. And, of course, many men are happy to follow the recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to cover their faces in public. Still, a narrative has emerged on the right that wearing a mask is weak and refusing to wear one is somehow strong. And that narrative could put everyone at risk.","1653189669","11"
"649","Long before the pandemic hit, masks were common in East Asian countries, where they’re seen as a simple way to protect yourself (and others) from disease, as Refinery29’s Connie Wang wrote in March. Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus outbreak began, started requiring them in January. The US was much slower to recommend masks for the general public, but in early April — with confirmed coronavirus cases jumping by the day — the CDC recommended that everyone wear a cloth mask in certain public settings. Some cities, like New York and Los Angeles, began mandating the wearing of masks in certain settings as well.","1653189669","11"
"650","Like much about the coronavirus, the impact of wearing masks on transmission isn’t entirely clear. But many experts believe that even cloth masks can offer some degree of protection for wearers — and perhaps greater protection for the people around them. The virus seems to spread “when germ-containing droplets make it into a person’s mouth, nose, or eyes,” as Vox’s German Lopez previously reported, and it’s true that “masks stop people from spreading their own droplets.” If everyone wears a mask — including those who are asymptomatic but may still be carrying the virus — it could help halt the spread of Covid-19.","1653189669","11"
"651","Most Americans appear to be on board with the CDC’s recommendation. In a Morning Consult poll (conducted from April 7 to 9), 72 percent of respondents said they planned to start wearing a face mask in public places over the next two weeks.","1653189669","11"
"652","Others, however, have chafed at the CDC’s advice. As people around the country protest their state’s shelter-in-place orders, many have appeared in public without masks. One example is the protesters in Michigan, which has become a hotbed of resistance to social distancing restrictions — a defiance Trump has encouraged via his tweets about “liberating” Michigan and other states. And on April 30, hundreds of protesters gathered at the state capitol in Lansing, some of them armed and many of them eschewing masks and standing close together in violation of social distancing guidelines, according to Reuters.","1653189669","11"
"653","One of the mask-less protesters was Brian Cash, who was photographed shouting during the event. He later told the Detroit Free Press he believes the coronavirus was “intentionally released” by the Chinese government and that the state’s stay-at-home order is useless because people still go to grocery stores and pharmacies. “So what is the point of staying at home?” he asked.","1653189669","11"
"654","The resistance to masks has also found support within the Trump administration. Pence, the head of the federal government’s coronavirus response, said he did not wear a mask while touring the Mayo Clinic in April because he is tested for Covid-19 regularly. (He later backpedaled and said he “should have” worn one.) But a mask-less Pence attended two events in Iowa on May 8, the same day his press secretary tested positive for the virus, according to the Intercept. At one of those events, CEOs were reportedly asked to remove their masks before joining Pence onstage.","1653189669","11"
"655","Trump, meanwhile, has consistently appeared in public without a mask. After he was photographed without one at the Honeywell plant in Arizona, he said he had worn one “backstage,” outside the view of cameras.","1653189669","11"
"656","Aides tested positive for the virus days later, and staffers have since been asked to wear masks on White House grounds, according to the Washington Post. Trump, however, is still unlikely to wear a mask himself, aides say.","1653189669","11"
"657","The Trump administration’s behavior around masks has gendered overtones. For Trump and Pence, not wearing a mask may be a way to project a macho image, Metzl said, playing into “tropes of indestructibility.”","1653189669","11"
"658","Such militaristic, tough-guy messaging, along with Trump’s refusal to wear a mask, may encourage ordinary people — especially men — to minimize the risk of coronavirus for the sake of appearing manly.","1653189669","11"
"659","While the refusal to wear masks isn’t an exclusively male phenomenon — a Michigan woman was arrested last month after police said she attacked a grocery store employee who told her to leave because she wasn’t wearing a mask — there is some evidence that men may view mask recommendations with more skepticism than women. In the April Morning Consult poll, 76 percent of women said they planned to wear a face mask in public over the next two weeks, compared with 67 percent of men.","1653189669","11"
"660","Though Trump’s narrative around the virus may be reinforcing gender stereotypes, the issue of masks is revealing Americans’ racial biases as well. While white men have been able to appear in public without masks — and with guns — as part of a protest, black men have been targeted by police, both for wearing and for not wearing masks. In Philadelphia, officers were caught on video forcibly removing a black man from a bus for not covering his face, just one day after the city began requiring it, Fabiola Cineas reported for Vox in April. And a police officer in Miami handcuffed and arrested Armen Henderson, a black doctor who tests homeless people for Covid-19, as he loaded equipment into a van in front of his home — while wearing a mask.","1653189669","11"
"661","Black Americans often have to engage in “social signaling” to make white people feel comfortable in public spaces, said Price, the political science professor. “You say good morning first, you smile first,” she said. “None of that can be done with masks.”","1653189669","11"
"662","White people often already perceive black people as dangerous or not belonging in public places, Price said. “But a black body with a mask is something that somehow expresses even more danger.”","1653189669","11"
"663","Meanwhile, for white protesters like those in Michigan, not wearing a mask may signal a kind of immunity from danger — or at least a perceived immunity. As white Americans, they’re unlikely to encounter the same kind of police brutality that black people face when they engage in protest. “Imagine 10 black men and rifles walking up to any state capitol in the United States,” Price said. “They would be shot before they ever made it up the steps.”","1653189669","11"
"664","But congregating in crowds without masks is also a statement of perceived immunity from the virus, Metzl said. The unmasked protesters seemed to be sending the message that “nothing’s going to happen to me because of my whiteness,” he explained. “If you thought you were really going to get the coronavirus, you wouldn’t act like that.”","1653189669","11"
"665","Obviously, the feeling of invincibility that leads protesters to avoid masks could backfire if they get sick. Pence and Trump may also find themselves rethinking their stance in the coming days since White House officials tested positive — Pence himself is reportedly keeping his distance from Trump and other staffers to avoid potentially exposing them.","1653189669","11"
"666","But the especially disturbing thing about refusing to wear a mask is that, while it may seem like an expression of toughness, it actually increases the risk to others more than yourself, Metzl said. While some may feel that not wearing a mask expresses their own invincibility, “You could also think about this in terms of all the other people you’re putting at risk by not wearing a mask,” he added — your family, friends, colleagues, the rest of society. The failure to wear one is “symbolic of a kind of loss of a bigger common sense of responsibility to each other.”","1653189669","11"
"667","Remedying that loss is not going to be as simple as sending the message that “tough guys wear masks,” Metzl said. (Washington Post humor columnist Alexandra Petri has suggested a tagline for a potential “Masks For Him” line of accessories: “We put the ‘mask’ in ‘toxic maskulinity.’”) Rather, the country has to look at what the current mask debate says about racism and other prejudices. “What we need is a much more concerted effort to address the bigger issues that are represented by masks,” Metzl said.","1653189669","11"
"668","For the Arizona Republic’s Frank, the confrontation over masks outside the Honeywell plant is part of a wider narrative around the virus. She recalled another incident in which a female reporter was accosted, this time by a woman, for wearing a mask. “I do think that what happened to all of us out there in the field on Tuesday is indicative of a larger issue” with how masks are viewed in the US, Frank said.","1653189669","11"
"669","But for her, wearing a mask is about one thing: public health. Frank lives with her mother, a nurse who treats Covid-19 patients. “I try to be really careful,” she told the people gathered outside the plant. “I try to protect myself and those around me.”","1653189669","11"
"670","Some of the advice reflected the message we’ve already heard for months: Wash your hands. Don’t touch your face. Wear a mask. Avoid shared surfaces and crowded settings, and keep physical distance — at least 6 feet — from people you don’t live with. If you’re 65 or older or have chronic health conditions, you should take all of this advice more seriously.","1668490842","11"
"671","After some mixed messaging from federal officials early on in the Covid-19 outbreak, there is widespread consensus that people should wear masks when they go out — a surgical or medical mask if they have one, a cloth one if they don’t. ","1668490842","11"
"672","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends masks “in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.” But other experts — and, in some cases, government mandates — go further, saying you should wear a mask in just about any setting outside your home as long as the pandemic continues.","1668490842","11"
"673","The primary reason for a mask is to stop transmission from the wearer to others, particularly from people who are infected but asymptomatic and therefore might not even know they’re infected. If you wear a mask, you’re less likely to spray virus-containing droplets on surfaces or other people when you breathe, talk, sing, laugh, sigh, snort, cough, sneeze, and whatever else you might do with your mouth and nose.","1668490842","11"
"674","A mask also likely offers some protection to you by creating a physical barrier to droplets from others in front of your mouth and nose (at least if you’re wearing it properly — make sure that it’s covering both).","1668490842","11"
"675","The initial research on masks wasn’t great, but it’s getting stronger. Several recent studies found masks alone reduce transmission. Some experts hypothesize — and early research suggests — that masks played a significant role in containing Covid-19 outbreaks in several Asian countries where their use is widespread, like South Korea and Japan.","1668490842","11"
"676","It can still be difficult, depending on where you live, to find medical masks. But there are cloth alternatives you can make at home. The CDC has an extensive tutorial. And here’s one from the US surgeon general:","1668490842","11"
"677","There are also things you can do to help others wear masks. For example, if you’re hosting a large event or even throwing a party — not advisable, but it will happen — offer masks to the people attending.","1668490842","11"
"678","When wearing a mask, don’t fidget with it — that would be touching your face — and avoid taking it off until you’re back home. Throw away disposable masks once they’re used, and wash reusable masks after you use them. ","1668490842","11"
"679","Masks are not an excuse to ease off on other hygiene practices. In fact, you want to wash your hands before and after taking off a mask — before, to avoid getting anything on your face and mask, and after, to get rid of anything that was on your mask.","1668490842","11"
"680","And yes, it’s normal to have a slightly harder time breathing while wearing a mask for a long time. But that discomfort should be weighed against the risk of getting sick or infecting others without a mask.","1668490842","11"
"681","It’s also possible to mitigate the risk of breaches in a closed circle by following the other tips on this list: Even when hanging out with your closed circle, go outside when possible, wear a mask, follow good hygiene, and keep physical distance from each other. A closed circle doesn’t have to be a license for much riskier behavior; it can just be an extra layer of protection if you want to regularly see other humans in person.","1668490842","11"
"682","A surprising number of Jessica Wu’s patients have approached her in recent months with questions about random bouts of mask-related irritation. While they’ve been in quarantine, the Los Angeles-based dermatologist told me, her clients have become more fixated on their skin than ever before; most rarely wore masks for an extended period of time prior to the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, those with more sensitive or oily skin have been seeing minor complications: acne breakouts, flare-ups of eczema or rosacea, or general skin irritation. ","1674177743","11"
"683","Dermatologists have reported seeing more acne breakouts over the past few months, although masks are not the only reason. People’s bodies (and skin) are adjusting to quarantine, and a pandemic has left many people more stressed, depressed, anxious, and restless — all factors that could increase the production of cortisol, which in turn affects oil production in the skin. ","1674177743","11"
"684","Has anyone found a good mask acne “mascne” solution yet? Girl is struggling","1674177743","11"
"685","In April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised the general public to wear non-medical masks and face coverings as a “voluntary public health measure” to slow the virus’s spread. Many states (or locales within states) have since issued mask mandates, requiring residents to cover their face in certain settings, such as on public transit and in grocery stores. ","1674177743","11"
"686","Many health care providers and essential workers, however, have been wearing specialized masks for hours at a time without taking them off since the pandemic began, to the point where many experienced painful skin breakage, chafing, and abrasions. Some have had to cushion their masks with bandages to reduce skin soreness, or readjusted straps around their head instead of around the ears.","1674177743","11"
"687","While many people are now experiencing firsthand the discomforts that can be caused by mask-wearing, they generally aren’t wearing a medical-grade respirator for long stretches of time every day. There are many more non-medical mask options to choose from (which aren’t as protective as the medical gear reserved for first responders), as many clothing retailers and companies have shifted gears to mass-produce fabric masks. ","1674177743","11"
"688","Wu recommends wearing masks made out of natural fibers, such as cotton, bamboo, or natural silk to reduce the likelihood of irritation. Face coverings properly fashioned out of these materials might be an effective barrier to aerosol particles, Wu said, citing a study by the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory. (One of the co-study’s authors, Supratik Guha of the University of Chicago, told PBS that a mask with 600-thread count cotton with two layers of silk or chiffon could provide adequate protection for wearers.) ","1674177743","11"
"689","A mask or a face covering traps moisture within the enclosed space between a person’s face and the fabric. That humidity, especially in warmer temperatures, could lead to breakouts and, in some cases, contact dermatitis, an uncomfortable itchy rash on the skin. Since many people are exercising with masks, excess oil, dirt, and sweat could also be trapped, leading to breakouts around the chin, jaw, cheeks, or mouth area. ","1674177743","11"
"690","Wu recommended using an oil-free makeup primer to reduce friction from the mask on the skin. Other over-the-counter products, like sulfur wash from your local drugstore, can further help treat breakouts. That’s why it’s even more crucial that people practice good hygiene, especially if they frequently wear a mask.","1674177743","11"
"691","Generally, a person shouldn’t touch their face or apply any products before washing their hands. The same idea applies to masks. A person should ideally wash their face with a gentle cleanser and soap their hands before putting on a mask and after taking it off. Be thorough in cleaning your nostrils and mouth as well, Wu advised. “Before you go out during the day, put on moisturizer or makeup if you wear it, hopefully sunblock, and then your mask on,” she said. “We’re taught in medical school to not touch the outside of your mask, since you can contaminate it from the outside with unclean hands.” ","1674177743","11"
"692","It might be tempting to pull down your mask to get some fresh air, but health experts advise against doing so until you’re in a safe and contained environment, like your car or home. But what if it’s a nice day and you’re in a park all by yourself? If that’s the case, Wu said, a person should at least sanitize their hands and put their mask in a plastic bag or in a sanitary place so they can rewear it when necessary.","1674177743","11"
"693","As the coronavirus pandemic continues, masks could become a staple health accessory in the US, in the way that they’re commonly worn in East Asia. Of course, that means Americans have to overcome their slight discomfort and, prior to Covid-19, the perceived stigma that comes with wearing them. Mask acne aside, Wu believes that people’s skin and their hygiene habits will adapt as time goes on. “My patients are surprisingly much more diligent about their skin care,” she said. “I do believe we’re going to hear less about it once people are more mindful of how masks affect their skin. Their next big concern might be mask tans.”","1674177743","11"
"694","Some of these travel tips include information health experts have reiterated for months: Wash your hands and don’t touch your face. Wear a mask in an indoor public space, and avoid removing it until you’ve reached your destination. If you’re 65 or older or have underlying health conditions that increase your risk for Covid-19, you should reconsider all nonessential travel. Whenever possible, avoid crowded settings and try to keep a physical distance of at least 6 feet from people you don’t live with.","1694728113","11"
"695","That doesn’t mean commuters should avoid public transit entirely, Baeten added. “Public transit is much safer now than it was in February everywhere in this country because of cleaning, masking, and since there are fewer people in each bus or car,” Baeten said. “All of those things make a big difference.” ","1694728113","11"
"696","Those mundane choices, like waiting for an emptier subway car, choosing an early commute time, or wearing a mask, could make a difference in terms of a person’s individual safety. On a larger scale, transit networks, airlines, long-distance buses, and trains have implemented consistent cleaning procedures, and many require passengers and crew to wear masks on board.","1694728113","11"
"697","According to Allen, if airlines require passengers to wear masks and properly space them apart, these measures will further reduce the risk of transmission during a flight. However, experts have warned that even with proper air ventilation, it’s also important to keep your distance from other people. (While most US airlines currently have policies requiring face coverings or masks, these rules aren’t necessarily enforced on board. People have also reported boarding alarmingly crowded flights during the pandemic.)","1694728113","11"
"698","“A plane that’s packed shoulder-to-shoulder, where no one’s wearing masks, is a completely different scenario than one where people are getting temperature checked before boarding, being spread out, and wearing masks,” Baeten told me.","1694728113","11"
"699","Meghan, like me, had already been committed to a natural birth and saw a home birth as best allowing her to be able to do that. “I feel like having that other layer of fear laying over things — is this nurse scared to be here, was she exposed, was she in the ICU last week, do they have proper masks, how many times have they worn that mask? — I don’t want to think about that while I’m giving birth. I just want to think about giving birth,” she said.","1696936454","11"
"700","It’s been more than a month now since I’ve moved upstate, having little physical contact with the outside world. I meet with my midwife every other week, and the personal attention is exactly what I need right now. She checks the baby’s heartbeat and tests for protein and glucose in my urine. We both wear masks. She palpates my stomach and can feel that my baby is already facing head down, ready to enter this strange world. If I were in Brooklyn, presumably a pared-down version of these appointments would be done by my obstetrician over a computer screen, which would be fine but certainly not the same as a warm hand on my belly. We’re currently gathering a list of supplies to have on hand for the delivery, like plastic sheets, extra towels, and flexible straws for my drinking comfort.","1696936454","11"
"701","Global desperation to protect front-line medical workers battling the coronavirus epidemic has spurred a mad international scramble for masks and other protective gear. Governments, hospital chains, clinics and entrepreneurs are scouring the world for personal protective equipment they can buy or sell — and a new type of trader has sprung up to make that happen.","1565080372","6"
"702","The stakes are high, and so are the prices. Wholesale costs for N95 respirators, a crucial type of mask for protecting medical workers, have quintupled. Trans-Pacific airfreight charges have tripled.","1565080372","6"
"703","The hurdles keep rising. On Tuesday, after complaints from Europe about shoddy Chinese masks and ineffective test kits, China’s Ministry of Commerce ordered manufacturers to provide further assurances that their products met standards.","1565080372","6"
"704","China vacuumed up a big share of global supplies after the outbreak emerged in January. It imported two billion masks in a five-week period starting then, according to Chinese customs data, roughly equivalent to two and a half months of global production. It also imported 400 million pieces of other protective gear, from medical goggles to biohazard coveralls.","1565080372","6"
"705","Now, China has become a major part of the solution. Already a giant in mask manufacturing, it has ramped up production to nearly 12 times its earlier level of 10 million a day. It was a huge mobilization effort that involved redesigning freight train routes and sending large numbers of workers across the country in sealed buses.","1565080372","6"
"706","The Chinese government has encouraged global deals, but buying and selling masks is no easy feat. Traders, some just weeks into their unstable careers, have to navigate confusion, fraud attempts, byzantine customs laws and other barriers.","1565080372","6"
"707","“It becomes so much easier when you deal with the procurement professionals, because they know exactly what they need,” said Blake Noah, a private banking art consultant who now arranges mask shipments in Shanghai.","1565080372","6"
"708","Some factories make products of suspect quality, and some sellers will even try to swindle buyers. Last Thursday, a court in the Chinese city of Shaoxing sentenced a man to over 10 years in prison for repeatedly selling what looked like a cargo of masks but had only tree branches inside.","1565080372","6"
"709","Mask traders in Shanghai say they have wasted time bargaining over rumored caches of masks before concluding that the only reliable suppliers are top managers at the factories themselves.","1565080372","6"
"710","“I’m still being put in touch with people who claim to have caches of 3M-branded masks,” Mr. Noah said. “But I’m skeptical such caches exist after looking at four or five phantom caches.”","1565080372","6"
"711","Some Chinese companies say they are ready to sell masks globally. Henan Doria Mechanical Equipment, a company in Zhengzhou that once made overhead cranes and electric hoists, has reinvented itself as a maker of N95 respirators and tells traders that it can meet orders for up to two million masks within 15 days.","1565080372","6"
"712","Once masks are found, they have to be transported. China’s cancellation of almost all of its international passenger flights to slow the spread of the virus has made it hard to move goods quickly. Half the world’s air cargo used to move in the bellies of passenger planes.","1565080372","6"
"713","Transportation of respirators or masks, Mr. Barner said, is “more complicated than auto parts.”","1565080372","6"
"714","Even though many hospitals in the United States are desperate for masks, selling to them isn’t always easy.","1565080372","6"

"720","Incheon’s 1,100 pharmacies, including Ms. Yoo’s, began to sell out of KF-94 face masks, the equivalent of the American N95. So did corner stores and large retail chains like E-Mart. As Koreans learned of the scale and aggressiveness of Covid-19, first from Chinese reports, then from a surge of cases at home, the mask with the weave and construction that proved most effective against the virus could not be found, except at exorbitant prices online. Customers grew angry waiting outside stores. One Incheon pharmacy posted a sign saying, “Regarding masks: Threats, physical violence and insults against employees are punishable under criminal law.”","1565187265","6"
"721","Such was the extent of the “mask crisis” when the central government decided to intervene in production and distribution. At the end of February, it announced that it would purchase 50 percent of KF-94 masks from the nation’s 130 or so manufacturers.

Licensed pharmacists were ideally placed to answer questions about Covid-19, give instructions on social distancing and proper use of masks, and refer sick people to field testing stations and hospitals. (In rural areas of South Korea, where there are fewer pharmacies, agricultural cooperative offices and post offices sell the face masks.)","1565187265","6"
"723","At Hankyeol Pharmacy, Ms. Yoo posted a sign on the door, telling customers that the sale of KF-94s would begin at 9 a.m. every morning. It was impossible to fill prescriptions or sell anything else during the mask rush. “All of us local pharmacists posted the various times of sale on our door and a map of all the nearby locations,” she told me. Popular mapping apps from Kakao and Naver also showed information on pharmacies and real-time numbers of available masks.","1565187265","6"
"724","Ms. Yoo was initially allotted 50 masks per day, six days a week, but this wasn’t nearly enough. As South Korea’s infection and fatality numbers grew, people felt desperate for protection. Across the country, pharmacists continued to face long lines and insults when masks sold out.","1565187265","6"
"725","On March 5, the government increased its share of mask purchases to 80 percent of national production. The following day, Ms. Yoo received a text message from President Moon Jae-in, addressed to “the pharmacists of Korea.” In addition to expanding mask manufacturing, the government was about to start a new rationing system.","1565187265","6"
"726","“Starting today, 70 percent of all masks acquired through the public distribution system will be sold at pharmacies,” Mr. Moon wrote. “Pharmacies are the primary on-the-ground node in our public health system.” All citizens and registered noncitizens could buy two masks per week on an assigned weekday, depending on their year of birth — a system similar to one used in Taiwan since early February.","1565187265","6"
"727","The Incheon Pharmaceutical Association encouraged its members to stay open on Sundays, to receive as many daily shipments as possible, so Ms. Yoo began working seven days a week. Her daily shipment went from 50 to 400 masks, with more on the weekends.","1565187265","6"
"728","This week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is weighing whether to recommend that everyone — not just health care workers and people infected with the coronavirus — wear masks. If this advice is issued, Americans may finally embrace wearing face masks, something that has long been common in East Asia, not only during disease outbreaks, but also during cold season and whenever air pollution levels rise.","1565187265","6"
"729","Such guidance could also worsen the already dire shortage of N95 face masks and other personal protective equipment. 3M has promised to make more than a billion N95 masks by the end of the year. But without a vast expansion of complementary manufacturing or imports, supplies will be inadequate.","1565187265","6"
"730","South Korea and Taiwan responded to their mask crises with significant market interventions. America needs to do the same. The U.S. government, and state and municipal bodies, should immediately enter into large-scale contracts to produce masks that can be sold at an affordable, standard price.","1565187265","6"
"731","These masks (and other personal protective equipment) should go first to health providers and hospitals, then to essential workers in sanitation, warehouses, transportation, food service, child-care centers, and people in prisons and detention facilities. A distribution plan along the lines of those in East Asia could then get masks to the public, perhaps through pharmacies, corner stores and post offices. Some of those masks should also be allocated, free of charge, to people who are homeless or living below the federal poverty level.","1565187265","6"
"732","For most of us, an N95 mask is not strictly necessary. Last weekend, I used a free online pattern to sew masks for myself and family members, using old handkerchiefs, shirts and elastic hair ties. I wore my homemade mask, reinforced with a large gauze bandage, to the grocery store and bodega, while trying to stay six feet away from fellow shoppers.","1565187265","6"
"733","To survive this pandemic, we Americans must stop viewing masks as a sign of disease, and see them instead as a social kindness, a courtesy as common as “please” and “thank you.” As Choi Gwi-ok, a pharmacist in northern Seoul, told me, “Koreans wear masks to protect themselves from infections, but, even more important, to show consideration for others in public.”","1565187265","6"
"734","Kuk Seung-gon, the president of the pharmacists’ association in Gimcheon, near South Korea’s Covid-19 hot spot, told me: “It’s been terrible to see what’s been happening in Europe and America. I really hope that, in the West, people develop a culture of mask wearing. A mask is not just for sick patients.”","1565187265","6"
"735","By the end of March, the lines for masks outside South Korea’s pharmacies had become manageable. “Now that people are able to buy two masks per week, they feel reassured,” Ms. Yoo told me. “We pharmacists do, too.”","1565187265","6"
"736","The message about face masks coming from American health officials has never been especially clear.","1565371274","6"
"737","When the coronavirus began spreading, officials seemed to be promoting two contradictory ideas: First, masks would not help keep people safe; and second, masks were so important that they should be reserved for doctors and nurses. It reminded me of the line credited to Yogi Berra about a New York restaurant: “Nobody goes there anymore — it’s too crowded.”","1565371274","6"
"738","The truth has become clearer in recent days. Masks probably do provide some protection. They’re particularly effective at keeping somebody who already has the virus from spreading it to others, and they may also make the mask’s wearer less likely to get sick. “Coronavirus appears to mostly spread when germ-containing droplets make it into a person’s mouth, nose, or eyes,” Vox’s German Lopez explains. “If you have a physical barrier in front of your mouth and nose, that’s simply less likely to happen.”","1565371274","6"
"739","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now reviewing whether to encourage Americans to wear masks. That would be a reversal and come after weeks of discouraging mask use. Many journalists, including me, previously quoted the experts who urged ordinary people not to wear masks.","1565371274","6"
"740","So what was the right solution? Zeynep Tufekci, a University of North Carolina professor, described it well in a Times Op-Ed more than two weeks ago. “The top-down conversation around masks has become a case study in how not to communicate with the public,” she wrote. Tufekci continued:","1565371274","6"
"741","“We had always said the sanctions are unjust but coronavirus revealed this injustice to the world,” Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said in a recent video message, which he began by removing a surgical mask from his face with blue latex gloves. He referred to the sanctions as “economic terrorism.”","1565685729","6"

"743","As coronavirus cases continue to soar in and around New York, doctors, nurses and others on the front lines say their supplies of medical-grade N95 and surgical masks are rapidly dwindling, with the worst of the epidemic yet to come.","1565795866","6"
"744","Hospitals in New York and other coronavirus hot spots “are running in short supply of N95 masks,” said Richard E. Peltier, an associate professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Hospitals have been conserving masks or reusing them to make them last.","1565795866","6"
"745","N95 masks are in acute demand among medical providers because they provide a tight fit and help prevent a person from inhaling small, airborne infectious particles. Last week, some N95 masks that are primarily intended for use in industrial settings, such as construction, were temporarily approved for medical use by the F.D.A. Surgical masks fit more loosely, but prevent the wearer from spreading droplets when coughing or sneezing.","1565795866","6"
"746","Now that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others are considering whether to recommend that people cover their faces in public, there is growing concern that people will start using medical masks when a scarf, kerchief or bandanna would be sufficient.","1565795866","6"
"747","Instead of hanging on to N95 and surgical masks, experts say, people should make their own and donate any medical masks for use in the health care system.","1565795866","6"
"748","For people in the New York area who happen to have respirator-type N95 masks or other medical-grade surgical masks at home or in storage and want to help medical workers in the region, there are several ways to donate them. Policies vary on whether opened or expired boxes of masks will be accepted. Donors should check with the individual groups first about what is accepted.","1565795866","6"
"749","The New York State Department of Health has an online form for donations of essential goods, such as medical masks.","1565795866","6"
"750","To donate, visit the department’s website and fill out the form, which breaks down donated goods by category, including medical supplies. There is a subcategory for “personal protective equipment: respirator/mask.” The form asks for the quantity, what area of the state you live in, how long the masks will be available and if you need help transporting the goods. Email COVID19supplies@esd.ny.gov for more information.","1565795866","6"

"755","PPE 2 NYC, a coalition of medical students, is collecting N95 and surgical masks, gloves and other items for area hospitals. Donors are encouraged to fill out an online form. The group has set up drop-off locations, and they can also pick items up.","1565795866","6"
"756","If you happen to know medical workers personally, you can reach out to them to drop off medical masks. The priority should be given to emergency room doctors and other medical professionals who are likely to come into contact with people infected by the coronavirus.","1565795866","6"
"757","“There is definite value in donating nonmedical masks that meet N95 standards because, at a minimum, they could be used by medical workers who may not be on the front line of patient care (orderlies and custodians, for example) and perhaps don’t need an advanced medical respirator but still need N95 protection,” Mr. Peltier said in an email.","1565795866","6"
"758","NYC Mask Crusaders allows artists, institution laborers and others to donate their extra masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment, including eyewear, clothing and isopropyl or ethyl alcohol. Through this platform, front-line workers can connect directly with donors. Donors should fill out one form per type of donated item, and someone will reach out directly to coordinate a pickup. Donors can also state whether their items are unopened, as the criteria varies among hospitals and medical facilities. There are chapters in several other cities across the United States, including Chicago, Boston and Los Angeles.","1565795866","6"

"764","For everyone else, the importance of social distancing, mask-wearing and good hygiene is only greater, since these practices not only decrease infectious spread but also tend to decrease dose and thus the lethalness of infections that do occur. While preventing viral spread is a societal good, avoiding high-dose infections is a personal imperative, even for young healthy people.","1565795862","6"
"765","At the same time, we need to avoid a panicked overreaction to low-dose exposures. Clothing and food packaging that have been exposed to someone with the virus seem to present a low risk. Healthy people who are together in the grocery store or workplace experience a tolerable risk — so long as they take precautions like wearing surgical masks and spacing themselves out.","1565795862","6"
"766","A complete lockdown of society is the most effective way to stop spread of the virus, but it is costly both economically and psychologically. When society eventually reopens, risk-reduction measures like maintaining personal space and practicing proper hand-washing will be essential to reducing high-dose infections. High-risk sites for high-dose exposure, like stadiums and convention venues, should remain shuttered. Risky but essential services like public transportation should be allowed to operate — but people must follow safety measures such as wearing masks, maintaining physical spacing and never commuting with a fever.","1565795862","6"

"774","Federal health officials appear ready to recommend that Americans of all ages start wearing masks for protection against the coronavirus, but millions of retail workers have been interacting with the public for weeks without them. Sometimes, they have been told that wearing masks could scare shoppers. Now many are scrambling to find available gear.","1565966249","6"
"775","The retailers’ different positions on masks, which follow those of the government, are indicative of how the industry has been fumbling through the fast-moving pandemic, potentially endangering workers. The restrictions could also increase the risk that their stores, which are virtually the only places where the public can still congregate, could be contributing to the spread of the virus.","1565966249","6"
"776","“Frankly, we had a fight with some employers because they didn’t want their employees wearing masks,” said John Grant, president of Local 770 of the United Food and Commercial Workers, which includes 20,000 grocery store workers in California. “Many workers are having to come up with them on their own.”","1565966249","6"
"777","At some grocery stores, customers and even a fire department were donating extra masks to employees, Mr. Grant said.","1565966249","6"
"778","In resisting calls from workers to provide them with masks, retailers have cited guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which continues to recommend masks only for health care workers and people showing symptoms of the virus.

"813","You may have heard that surgical masks don’t work for preventing viral infections and may increase the risk of infection. Why is this? It is because people not accustomed to wearing masks can’t keep their hands off them. They constantly fiddle with them, adjust them, pull them down to talk and so on.

Various studies point to similar results for those homemade face coverings, particularly when combined with hand-washing hygiene.","1566939180","6"
"829","Even if masks don’t completely protect each individual, they could considerably reduce the spread of the virus. Even if the coverings only reduced transmission to and from each wearer by half, that would reduce the chance of spread by 75 percent. So face coverings could reduce the exponential growth of new infections and avert disaster in America’s hot spots.","1566939180","6"
"830","Because scientists cannot rule out with complete confidence that this coronavirus can be spread easily in the air, even outdoors, we believe it’s most prudent to promote face covering in all public settings. And to state the obvious, mask wearing and face covering is not a substitute for shelter-in-place, hand-washing and other protective measures.","1566939180","6"
"831","Those wearing a mask may be stigmatized, since they might be presumed to be sick, given current government guidance. A national policy on face coverings for all, even those who have had the disease, like our co-author Dr. Kass, could eliminate that stigma. Wearing masks is a way we can all protect each other.","1566939180","6"
"832","Wearing masks will not only reduce viral spread, it would also help us return to work, get back to school, and avoid what could be a devastating second wave of the coronavirus.","1566939180","6"
"833","While ensuring that all health workers have full protective equipment, and as many essential workers as possible have medical masks, President Trump, federal health officials, governors and mayors should call on Americans in well-populated cities and towns to wear face coverings or masks in all public areas. (Government officials should start by wearing masks themselves, particularly in media appearances, to reduce the stigma and encourage use.)","1566939180","6"
"834","But workers said the week of paid leave was insufficient, and noted that many of the bonuses distributed so far have amounted to only a couple of hundred dollars or less. They also expressed misgivings about the inconsistent safety measures across stores, where some managers have banned gloves and face masks, saying they frighten customers.","1567011815","6"
"835","Juan Boria, an employee at a Trader Joe’s in the East Village in Manhattan, said he went to work last week wearing a mask made with fabric cut from a Hawaiian shirt so it would resemble the rest of the company uniform.","1567011815","6"
"836","A manager told him not to wear the mask in front of customers and sent him to the stockroom, where he found it difficult to stay six feet away from his co-workers. Mr. Boria left in the middle of the shift, fearing for his safety.","1567011815","6"
"837","At various times, Trader Joe’s has said employees are allowed to wear masks and gloves. But individual stores have adopted different protocols, and some of the chain’s messages have confused employees.","1567011815","6"
"838","Now, however, medical experts are beginning to recommend protective equipment for retail workers. Ms. Friend-Daniel said Trader Joe’s planned to supply masks for its stores, as other chains, like Walmart, have begun to do.","1567011815","6"
"839","When a doctor at one of New York City’s top hospitals arrived for work on Tuesday night, she found the following items in the bag of protective equipment that she received: a mask, an eye shield — and, in place of the usual medical gown, a plastic white-and-navy New York Yankees poncho, the kind available for purchase on rainy game days.","1567035222","6"
"840","Early in the pandemic, tensions over protective equipment came to a head when a fistfight broke out among workers and visitors at one of the Montefiore hospitals over access to masks, several Montefiore staffers said. After that incident, administrators locked up masks and other gear across the system and began rationing them.","1567035222","6"
"841","At first, Montefiore barred workers from using full protective gear except around patients who had tested positive for the virus or had a pending test, according to the staffers. Later, it said workers should wear heavy-duty N95 masks only when performing major procedures.","1567035222","6"
"842","On March 25, the system started ordering doctors and nurses to wear the same N95 masks for up to three days at a time, according to an email obtained by The Times. That plan called for masks to be distributed on Mondays and Thursdays and reused in between.","1567035222","6"
"843","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is close to recommending that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public, a change in position that reflects new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms and new data suggesting the United States is not yet slowing the rate of infections.","1567119087","6"
"844","At a White House briefing Thursday evening, both President Trump and Vice President Pence said that new guidance on masks would be issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the coming days. But the comments of both Mr. Trump and a top official on the administration’s coronavirus response task force during the session suggested that the issue hasn’t been entirely resolved within the administration.","1567119087","6"
"845","“If people want to wear them, they can,” President Trump said, declaring that while the administration was “coming out with regulations” on mask wearing soon, whether to follow them was a personal choice.","1567119087","6"
"846","Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, sounded a sharper note of caution, saying that she did not want Americans to get a false sense of security from wearing masks. Washing hands and keeping six feet away from other people were more protective steps, she said, and suggested that the still-unannounced new guidance remained under debate.","1567119087","6"
"847","“The eyes are not in the mask. If you are touching things and touching your eyes, you’re exposing yourself in the same way,” Dr. Birx said. “This will be an additive piece if it comes out, rather than saying it is a substitute for it. It is not a substitute for the presidential guidelines that have already gone out.”","1567119087","6"
"848","Her caveats on masks reflect what has been a common view among many public health bodies about the effectiveness of masks for the general public. Until now, the C.D.C., like the World Health Organization, has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason has been to preserve medical-grade masks, including N95 respirator masks, for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply.","1567119087","6"
"849","Public health officials have continued to stress, however, that N95 masks and surgical masks should be saved for front-line doctors and nurses, who have been in dire need of protective gear. In the briefing, President Trump suggested that homemade face coverings, like scarves, would suffice.","1567119087","6"
"850","He was most concerned about widespread hoarding of the tightfitting N95 masks that can stop infectious particles even finer than a micron in diameter, and that even many health care workers have not been able to find.","1567119087","6"
"851","But earlier this week, Mr. Trump said that broad use of nonmedical masks, at least, was “certainly something we could discuss.”","1567119087","6"
"852","Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the C.D.C., confirmed in a radio interview earlier this week that the agency was reviewing its guidelines on who should wear masks. Citing new data that shows high rates of transmission from people who are infected but show no symptoms, he said the guidance on mask wearing was “being critically re-reviewed, to see if there’s potential additional value for individuals that are infected or individuals that may be asymptomatically infected.”","1567119087","6"
"853","While wearing masks to prevent the spread of disease is a widely accepted practice in many Asian countries, it remains to be seen how Americans would react to such a recommendation. But a growing number of public health experts have been recommending universal mask use.","1567119087","6"
"854","And a white paper from a group of Yale researchers released on Thursday estimated that universal mask use could reduce infections by around 10 percent, creating a value of $3,000 to $6,000 per American, based on estimates of the value of saved lives. The authors included Sten H. Vermund, the dean of the Yale School of Public Health, and Albert Ko, the chairman of Yale Medical School’s department of epidemiology and microbial diseases.","1567119087","6"
"855","Both papers recommended that members of the public wear homemade cloth masks, to preserve limited supplies of surgical masks and higher-grade respirators for health care workers.","1567119087","6"
"856","“It is critically important that public adoption not come at the expense of medical mask availability for health workers,” said Jason Abaluck, an associate professor of economics at the Yale School of Management and a co-author of the paper. “This is why we emphasize universal adoption of cloth masks.”","1567119087","6"
"857","The researchers emphasized that the primary benefit of mask wearing was to prevent infected people from spreading the virus by expelling infected droplets.","1567119087","6"
"858","President Trump said on Friday that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was urging all Americans to wear a mask when they leave their homes, but he immediately undercut the message by repeatedly calling the recommendation voluntary and saying that he would not wear one himself.","1567306969","6"
"859","“With the masks, it is going to be a voluntary thing,” the president said at the beginning of the daily coronavirus briefing at the White House. “You can do it. You don’t have to do it. I am choosing not to do it. It may be good. It is only a recommendation, voluntary.”","1567306969","6"
"860","“Wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens — I don’t know,” he added, though he stopped receiving foreign dignitaries weeks ago. “Somehow, I just don’t see it for myself.”","1567306969","6"
"861","The mask debate has played out in public and in private. Mr. Trump said Americans who choose to comply with the C.D.C.’s recommendation should use a basic cloth or face mask, not medical- or surgical-grade masks that are used by hospital workers and emergency workers. He also said people must still follow social distancing guidelines, which he called the “safest way to avoid the infection.”","1567306969","6"
"862","Senior officials at the C.D.C. have been pushing the president for days to advise everyone — even people who appear to be healthy — to wear a mask or a scarf that covers their mouth and nose when shopping at the grocery store or while in other public places.","1567306969","6"
"863","Local officials in Germany and France have accused American buyers of outbidding them for protective masks that had been lined up for medical workers fighting the coronavirus in Europe. The masks, they claim, were already at Asian airports, about to be shipped.","1567306969","6"
"864","A Berlin city legislator said unidentified Americans somehow acquired 200,000 protective masks that had been meant for first-responders and hospital workers in the German capital.","1567306969","6"
"865","German media reported that the masks had been at the airport in Bangkok, where they were supposed to have been loaded onto a Germany-bound plane, but instead were diverted to a plane bound for the United States.","1567306969","6"
"866","Another shipment of protective masks was in China and bound for the Paris region when, French officials say, it was purchased by unidentified American buyers offering more money.","1567306969","6"
"867","In a statement released on Friday, the U.S. Embassy in France said that “the United States government has not purchased any masks intended for delivery from China to France,” adding that “reports to the contrary are completely false.”","1567306969","6"
"868","The Trump administration is trying to use its wartime powers to cut off 3M’s ability to export face masks abroad, as well as claim more of the masks the company manufactures in other countries for use in the United States. Such a policy would be a dramatic expansion of the U.S. government’s reach as it seeks to procure much-needed protective gear for American health care workers. ","1567306969","6"
"869","But some trade and legal experts fear new mandates could backfire, causing other governments to clamp down on exports of masks, ventilator parts and pharmaceuticals that the United States desperately needs. They have also questioned whether the Defense Production Act gives the government the authority to commandeer goods made beyond United States borders. ","1567306969","6"
"870","Anastasia Vasilieva, the head of the Alliance of Doctors, was stopped by the police on Thursday and held overnight while traveling from Moscow to an impoverished rural town to deliver masks, gloves and other supplies to a hospital, according to a colleague who was traveling with her.","1567306969","6"
"871","In New York, security officers have been posted outside precincts to screen people entering in an effort to minimize foot traffic, and face masks are being used inside some precinct station houses. Some commanders have moved their daily roll calls outdoors so that officers can spread out. Officers on patrol are carrying N95 masks to pop on if they feel endangered.","1567424500","6"
"872","As the virus has spread, the availability of masks, gloves, hand sanitizer and disinfectant has become a point of contention between police commanders and the rank and file. Police officials say the department has a sufficient supply of respirator masks, gloves and disinfectants, but it has instructed officers to use the equipment sparingly.","1567424500","6"
"873","Police union leaders say the department did not distribute enough of the equipment in the early days of the crisis and supplies are still short. For instance, one police official said, the special victims squad in Brooklyn received just 15 masks for 28 detectives, who sometimes must visit hospitals that have coronavirus patients to meet victims of sex crimes and retrieve rape kits.","1567424500","6"
"874","Some officers said in interviews that they believe a shortage of masks and gloves, especially in the early days of crisis, was partly to blame for the rapid rise in infections in their ranks. They requested anonymity to speak without department approval.","1567424500","6"
"875","One Brooklyn detective who contracted the virus said in a text message that he had been given only one N95 mask and two disinfectant wipes to use over several days. He said he had no choice but to reuse the mask on a daily basis.","1567424500","6"
"876","“They are one-time use only mask,” the detective wrote. “I mean, there’s only one mask. So it’s either we reuse or we don’t have anything.” He was later diagnosed with the coronavirus after getting a sore throat, headaches and a dry cough.","1567424500","6"
"877","Another detective said that, aside from being given meager supplies — including four surgical face masks, four sets of plastic gloves and eight sanitizer wipes to use while on assignment — she was not given much guidance from supervisors.","1567424500","6"
"878","An officer assigned to the South Bronx, who fears passing the virus to his young children, was more blunt: “It’s a damn shame that a city like New York that is the epicenter of the coronavirus and the financial capital of the world can’t afford a $3 mask.”","1567424500","6"
"879","Monique Dixon, 45, Detective Dixon’s younger sister, said her brother did not complain about the lack of masks and gloves. He was the type to head toward danger without thinking twice, she said, holding back tears.","1567424500","6"
"880","At the end of seven hours in mask, gown and gloves at Bellevue Hospital Center on Monday, Dr. Richard Levitan finally had a chance to look at his phone.","1567555862","6"
"881","EARLY ARRIVAL It’s a 13-minute walk to work, but I’m lazy, so I’ll drive there and arrive by around 9:15, which is early because we need time to sanitize everything. That’s new. So is the line of people wearing masks that stand outside. That moment is an awakening. It started last week since we can only let in 10 people at a time. We have tape on the floor now in the pharmacy area that’s six feet apart. People like to crowd around the pharmacy so they’re a little frustrated because they haven’t gotten used to it yet.","1567555849","6"
"882","DEALING WITH CUSTOMER ANXIETY I put on my jacket and roll up the gate. Our hours have always been shorter on Sundays, but with the virus there’s an increase in people and pace. People are very anxious; I can see it in their faces. They are asking for their daily essentials: masks, alcohol, Tylenol, hand sanitizer, they’re worried and frantically looking for items.","1567555849","6"
"883","WIPE IT DOWN, ROLL IT DOWN At 2 we roll down the gate. I’m not wearing a mask or gloves during the day, but I put on gloves to disinfect everything, which we do with Clorox wipes. I wipe down anything I’ve touched; the counters, phones, keyboard, pin pad. Then I throw out the garbage, get into my car and drive home.","1567555849","6"
"884","There were advertisements for gallons of hand sanitizer, crates of isolation gowns and, most crucially, pallets of N95 masks — perhaps the most sought-after product on the planet. All were for prices that were multiples higher than what she normally paid.","1567811307","6"
"885","“All of these people are coming out of the woodwork, and all of them mysteriously now have access to an abundant supply,” said Ms. Houghtelling, who works for three hospitals owned by Arnot Health, based in Elmira. She forwarded dozens of messages to The New York Times from brand-new vendors. One offered her boxes of 50 surgical masks for $70 each; she used to pay $2.28.","1567811307","6"
"886","One solicitor in particular caught her attention: Blank Industries, a company that offered N95 masks for nearly $5 each — and only if Ms. Houghtelling ordered a million. She figured it was a scam.","1567811307","6"
"887","Blank Industries is a real company, but it’s an ice-melt manufacturer in Hudson, Mass. In an interview, Andrew Blank, the founder, said he had upended his business to sell masks after hearing from a former Chinese supplier he had once hired to make a new kind of toothbrush. (Mr. Blank had invented it.) After the coronavirus hit, the supplier turned his dental-products plant into a mask factory. Mr. Blank told his 12 employees to stop selling rock salt and start selling masks.","1567811307","6"
"888","The eruption in demand for dwindling amounts of masks has resulted in a kind of global supply-chain bedlam. In the United States, the federal government has decided against commandeering American factories to create a new stream of masks. Instead, federal officials are competing against states, hospitals and medical suppliers for the same pool of masks, which come mostly from China.","1567811307","6"
"889","That frenzy has created a mess of confusion, according to interviews with hospitals, factories and mask buyers. Production of masks is soaring, but so are scams, logistical hurdles and, of course, prices.","1567811307","6"
"890","After the coronavirus outbreak began, China imported two billion masks. France ordered a billion and vowed to become self-sufficient by year-end. The U.S. government has done comparatively little to coordinate purchasing and ensure that American governments and hospitals aren’t competing.","1567811307","6"
"891","Last month, federal officials agreed to buy roughly 600 million N95 masks over the next 18 months. But many states and hospitals are desperate for supplies right now, and the government has already nearly exhausted the supply of protective gear in the national stockpile. On Thursday, the White House said it had invoked the Defense Production Act, a 1950s law, to ensure the manufacturing giant 3M sends a certain share of its masks to the United States.","1567811307","6"
"892","Some of the entrepreneurs stepping up in the government’s stead have succeeded. Operation Masks, a two-week-old nonprofit run by tech executives, said it had just closed deals for one million N95s for New York State and 200,000 for Hawaii, charging just over $3 for each mask, not including shipping and other costs. On Thursday, Massachusetts received 1.2 million N95 masks via the New England Patriots team plane.","1567811307","6"
"893","The hospital is prepared to pay more for masks, but it does not want to buy counterfeit gear. “You’re in this uncharted territory where you’re struggling to just at least validate,” Mr. Bonetti said. “The last thing we want to do is put product on a clinician that is not going to protect them.”","1567811307","6"
"894","Not every new entrant to the market is a good Samaritan. Groups on Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram are teeming with posts hawking thousands of masks at inflated prices.","1567811307","6"
"895","Some are wholesalers who bought pallets of masks from China or in liquidation sales and then marked them up. Many more are simply middlemen who call themselves brokers. They scour the groups for masks advertised for a relatively low price, and then repost the offer for a few thousand dollars more. They don’t handle the masks or put up their own money.","1567811307","6"
"896","Yaear Weintroub is one of those brokers. A 22-year-old community college student from Brooklyn, he typically sells wholesale electronics to Amazon sellers. But the online forums he searches for deals became flooded with listings for masks last month, so he now spends his days trying to connect buyers and sellers for a bit of medical-supply arbitrage.","1567811307","6"
"897","In a recent interview, he said he was working with a partner to close a deal for 280,000 surgical masks that would increase their price 20 percent and net the pair a roughly $40,000 profit. He said many of the brokers sold to other brokers, each one marking up the price, until the masks presumably make it to a nursing home or a hospital. He said he would prefer to sell directly to hospitals.","1567811307","6"
"898","To these sellers, medical supplies are simply another hot product to flip for a profit. Avraham Eisenberg, a New York wholesaler who is trying to ship masks from China, compared the rush for masks to the fad several years ago for fidget spinners.","1567811307","6"
"899","The Justice Department said last month that it would investigate people manipulating the medical-supply market. Five days later, federal authorities charged a Brooklyn man with lying about price gouging after he tried to sell 1,000 masks and other supplies to a doctor for $12,000. (He also was charged with assault after he claimed he had the coronavirus and coughed on F.B.I. agents.) Federal officials are now distributing the more than half a million supplies they confiscated from him.","1567811307","6"
"900","In China, the competition is intense. A small number of Chinese factories are certified by the Food and Drug Administration to make N95 masks, and “those are the diamonds right now,” said Lily Liu, a Chinese hospital executive turned Silicon Valley entrepreneur who now helps run Operation Masks.","1567811307","6"
"901","That demand has fueled the spike in prices. While some factory owners are probably making handsome margins, much of the price increase is likely spread across the supply chain, from the firms that ship and inspect the masks to those that make the masks’ fabric and the machines that assemble them.","1567811307","6"
"902","Take Zhou Hua, the owner of a factory in Xuancheng, China, that months ago made children’s clothing. In February, as the coronavirus swept across his country, he rushed to buy mask machines and spent roughly $500,000 transforming his plant. Now his staff has nearly doubled to 75 employees, and they make 1.6 million masks a day.","1567811307","6"
"903","He said his margins were modest, and blamed higher material costs for much of the price increases. Most masks use melt-blown fabric to stop tiny particles. Mr. Zhou said the price of that material had risen 90 percent to about $53 a ton. He added that the price for machines that weld straps to the masks had tripled, to roughly $2,100.","1567811307","6"
"904","The people jumping into the mask market come from across the spectrum. Dan Schonfeld, for instance, sells pool noodles. He’s pretty good at it, too. He found a reliable supplier in China, slapped sports teams’ logos on them and built a steady business through PoolPartsToGo.com.","1567811307","6"
"905","When the coronavirus spread last month to his home state, New York, Mr. Schonfeld thought he could use his connections in China to get masks to American doctors. He dropped his pool-supply business and began pursuing masks, vowing not to earn a cent.","1567811307","6"
"906","He worked his iPhone around the clock, calling American hospitals by day and Chinese contacts by night. The hospitals were all interested, but reliable masks were in short supply.","1567811307","6"
"907","Then, just before midnight on March 19, his pool-noodle supplier in Ningbo, China, Jensen Jiang, emailed with news. He had secured a deal with a nearby factory for 100,000 N95 masks at $2.70 each. But competing orders were coming in, he said, so Mr. Schonfeld had to decide quickly.","1567811307","6"
"908","The next day, Mr. Schonfeld excitedly called the hospitals. But executives who had expressed such desperation for masks were suddenly wary of turning over $270,000 to a man who was selling pool parts just days before. One replied “We just don’t know you,” Mr. Schonfeld said. “It turned into me needing help.”","1567811307","6"
"909","Then he awoke to more bad news. “I am afraid that I made big trouble to you,” Mr. Jiang said in a March 26 email. “All the masks were taken by government.” The email included a photo of a closure notice on the factory’s doors, dated 11 days earlier. Mr. Schonfeld didn’t know what to believe.","1567811307","6"
"910","As Mr. Jiang negotiated a refund, which still hasn’t arrived, they decided to find and ship a different mask: the so-called KN95, China’s effective version of the N95. Mr. Schonfeld ordered 150,000 from a new factory and booked a freight plane for April 3.","1567811307","6"
"911","But then there was another catch: The F.D.A.’s guidelines for medical use of KN95 masks in the United States were murky, and Mr. Schonfeld’s lawyers warned that officials could seize them. (On April 2, the agency said it would not block imports of the masks.)","1567811307","6"
"912","The best illustration of this challenge is the changing consensus and public messaging on wearing masks.","1567913099","6"
"913","At the end of February, as the coronavirus was spreading in the United States, the surgeon general, Jerome Adams, argued that masks were not effective for the general public, tweeting, “STOP BUYING MASKS!”","1567913099","6"
"914","He suggested that the priority was always to reserve masks for health care workers. “But I don’t think we understood or put in context how masks might affect physical distancing in public,” he said. “You’re trying to juggle a number of considerations in real time, and the wrong balancing act was struck.”","1567913099","6"
"915","On Friday, President Trump announced that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had changed the recommendation on masks to say that all Americans should use “non-medical, cloth” ones. “You can do it. You don’t have to do it. I’m choosing not to do it,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s only a recommendation.”","1567913099","6"
"916","Renée DiResta, an expert on disinformation at the Stanford Internet Observatory, suggested to me that the mask fiasco was a result of bureaucracies’ responding on the fly to a new threat. “What you have is an institution that’s not designed for real-time communication or the modern information world,” she said.","1567913099","6"
"917","For people in the New York area who have respirator-type N95 masks or other medical-grade surgical masks at home, there are several ways to get them to people who really need them right now: local medical workers","1567919571","6"
"918","On his first shift, the neurosurgeon, who declined to be identified for fear of retribution, was assigned a N-95 mask and told to use it indefinitely. Several times an hour, code blue alerts were called out on the hospital loudspeaker, indicating a medical emergency. “Everybody is dug in for the long haul,” he said.","1568002872","6"
"919","With doctors, nurses and other health care workers facing acute shortages of protective masks, the Food and Drug Administration announced on Friday that it will allow use of a more widely available mask that meets Chinese standards instead of American ones.","1568236382","6"
"920","Hospitals across the United States are running out of N95 masks, which filter at least 95 percent of particles that are 0.3 microns or larger, including the new coronavirus. N95 masks are tested and certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, a research agency that is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","1568236382","6"
"921","On Friday, the F.D.A. issued an emergency use authorization for KN95 masks. Regulated by the Chinese government, they are almost identical in performance to N95 masks. There are slight differences in their specifications, like a variation in the maximum pressure the masks must be able to withstand as a person inhales and exhales.","1568236382","6"
"922","The C.D.C. lists KN95 masks as a suitable alternative when N95s are not available.","1568236382","6"
"923","The F.D.A. said KN95 masks were eligible for authorization if they met certain criteria, including documentation that they were authentic.","1568236382","6"

"930","WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Friday that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was urging all Americans to wear a mask when they leave their homes, but he immediately undercut the message by repeatedly calling the recommendation voluntary and promising that he would not wear one himself.","1568289640","6"
"931","“With the masks, it is going to be really a voluntary thing,” the president said at the beginning of the daily coronavirus briefing at the White House. “You can do it. You don’t have to do it. I am choosing not to do it. But some people may want to do it, and that’s OK. It may be good. Probably will — they’re making a recommendation. It’s only a recommendation, it’s voluntary.”","1568289640","6"
"932","“Wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens — I don’t know,” he added. “Somehow, I don’t see it for myself.”","1568289640","6"
"933","The mask debate has played out in public and in private. Mr. Trump said Americans who choose to comply with the C.D.C.’s recommendation should use a basic cloth or face mask, not medical- or surgical-grade masks that are used by hospital workers and emergency workers. He also said people must still follow social distancing guidelines, which he called the “safest way to avoid the infection.”","1568289640","6"
"934","Senior officials at the C.D.C. have been pushing the president for days to advise everyone — even people who appear to be healthy — to wear a mask or a scarf that covers their mouth and nose when shopping at the grocery store or while in other public places.","1568289640","6"
"935","The issue became more urgent after the C.D.C.’s director, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, said that as many as a quarter of those already infected may show no symptoms but still contribute to “significant” transmission. Local officials in New York and Los Angeles have already called for people to cover their faces in public. On Friday, the governor of Pennsylvania called on his state’s residents to wear masks when they go out.","1568289640","6"
"936","Matthew Pottinger, the deputy national security adviser, who has been wearing a mask during meetings in the White House, has shown people studies that advocate the wide use of masks, one official said. Other officials believed that was excessive.","1568289640","6"
"937","One top C.D.C. official who has seen emails from people in the West Wing said that some of Mr. Trump’s advisers were pressing him to recommend mask wearing only in “areas of widespread transmission.” That worried C.D.C. officials because the virus has already spread, largely undetected to most parts of the country. Wearing masks or other face coverings everywhere, including in places where there are few reported cases, will help slow the rate of infection, they believe.","1568289640","6"
"938","Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus response, expressed serious reservations on Thursday, saying that asking all Americans to wear masks could inadvertently signal that Americans can abandon social distancing and return to public life as long as they wear a mask.","1568289640","6"
"939","“We don’t want people to feel like, ‘Oh, I’m wearing a mask. I’m protected and I’m protecting others,’” Dr. Birx said at the daily briefing. Others at the White House have expressed worry that asking all Americans to wear masks could heighten shortages for doctors, nurses and emergency workers, even if they urge people not to seek the highly protective, and scarce, N95 masks used by hospital staff.","1568289640","6"
"940","Dr. Fauci said in an interview on CNN this week that “you don’t want to take masks away from the health care providers who are in a real and present danger of getting infected.”","1568289640","6"
"941","Hospitals across the country are running out of N95 masks, which filter at least 95 percent of particles that are 0.3 microns or larger. In a move to increase the availability of the masks, the Food and Drug Administration said Friday it would allow use of a Chinese equivalent.","1568289640","6"
"942","Skeptics inside the administration also raised doubts about whether people in the United States would ever feel comfortable wearing masks in public, noting that the cultural norms are different in America from some Asian countries, where the use of masks became more common after previous outbreaks.","1568289640","6"
"943","Some conservatives have said they did not believe that Americans would ever accept wide usage. Michael Dougherty, a conservative writer at National Review, wrote that Americans would “quickly feel that masks are ridiculous, menacing, or an imposition on life, then conclude they must be temporary.”","1568289640","6"
"944","Mr. Trump’s personal hesitance also underscored questions about whether other politicians or media personalities would choose to wear masks while appearing in public.","1568289640","6"
"945","Outside of the White House, the move toward masks accelerated quickly this week. On Friday, after Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, urged residents of his state to wear masks if they ventured out of their homes, the state’s health secretary reiterated that staying at home — away from groups of people — remained the most effective way to ensure that the virus would not spread.","1568289640","6"
"946","“A mask isn’t a pass to go back to work, or go visit friends, or go socialize,” said the health secretary, Dr. Rachel Levine.","1568289640","6"
"947","At the World Health Organization briefing on Friday, Dr. Michael J. Ryan, the executive director of the health emergency program, said that while the W.H.O. still recommended masks only for front-line health workers and those who are sick or caring for someone who is, “we can certainly see circumstances in which the use of masks, both homemade or cloth masks, at community level may help in an overall comprehensive response to this disease.”","1568289640","6"
"948","Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, has been one of the most vocal supporters of wearing masks. In an interview from the basement of his home, where he is isolating because of his recent contact with lawmakers who tested positive for the virus, he said wearing masks would help limit the effect of it.","1568289640","6"
"949","“It just makes sense to have some kind of physical barrier that would reduce the droplets that are released when people speak and breathe,” Mr. Toomey said. “The idea is to protect everyone else. My mask protects you. Your mask protects me.”","1568289640","6"
"950","Mr. Toomey said he spoke with Mr. Trump on Wednesday to urge him to recommend masks for everyone. He said the president seemed “very sympathetic” to the idea but did not reveal his course.","1568289640","6"
"951","He said it was “premature” to conclude that Americans would not wear masks. “Who’s to say that people won’t respond in a way that this becomes acceptable and normal?” he asked.","1568289640","6"
"952","Evidence arguing for the use of face masks to limit the spread of the coronavirus continues to mount. A study published Friday in the journal Nature found that flat surgical face masks significantly reduced the number of virus-carrying droplets that mask wearers released into the surrounding air.","1568289640","6"
"953","The researchers asked 246 people with suspected respiratory viral infections to breathe into a machine for 30 minutes to measure the amount of virus they exhaled. Half of the participants wore a face mask, while the other half performed the experiment without any face covering. Among 111 people whose infections were later confirmed with a lab test, masks stopped the spread of all seasonal coronavirus and more than 70 percent of influenza virus infections, the study showed. Masks were not as effective in reducing transmission of rhinoviruses, or the common cold.","1568289640","6"
"954","For the current coronavirus pandemic, all health officials, including those at the W.H.O. and C.D.C., agree that masks should be worn by anyone with symptoms like a cough or fever, and anyone caring for someone with a confirmed or suspected case.","1568289640","6"
"955","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised all Americans — even people who appear to be healthy — to cover their face with a mask or a scarf when they leave home to help slow the spread of the coronavirus in the United States.","1568289638","6"
"956","So far, the increased demand for masks far outstrips the supply. That has left desperate people, and hospitals, navigating a marketplace rife with profiteers and scammers.","1568289638","6"
"957","U.S. states and hospitals, whose normal suppliers are overwhelmed, have been left to negotiate directly with Chinese suppliers, which make most of the world’s masks. To fill the void, middlemen have rushed in. N95 masks, usually 50 cents apiece, were offered to one hospital for nearly $5 each by a company in Massachusetts, which itself had bought them from a Chinese manufacturer for $4.75.","1568289638","6"
"958","Hoarding has also affected the supply chain. This week, federal authorities seized a medical stockpile that included more than 320,000 masks from a man in Brooklyn.","1568289638","6"

"962","For the past few months, public health officials have been unyielding in their stance that healthy people should not wear masks as a way to protect themselves from coronavirus.","1568349320","6"
"963","But with new information about how the virus is spread — potentially through the air and by people with no symptoms — the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday recommended that everyone wear nonmedical face coverings in public settings. President Trump said the guidelines were voluntary, leaving the decision about wearing masks up to individuals. Top health officials, including Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, warned that masks should not replace social distancing and hand washing.","1568349320","6"
"964","While longtime advocates for mask wearing applaud the shift, they said it should also include a plan for providing masks to the public. For now, commercially made masks are virtually impossible to find. Many people have hoarded masks in recent months, and everyone agrees that any available supply of medical masks should be reserved for hospitals and emergency workers. That means if you want a mask, you probably have to make it yourself.","1568349320","6"
"965","“We have a $3 trillion stimulus package and a mask costs very little — they should be free,” said Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee, assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University.","1568349320","6"
"966","Last week, the German Medical Association suggested that citizens find or make a simple fabric mask when out in public and leave medical-grade masks for front-line workers. In Austria, grocery store shoppers are now required to wear masks. In New York City, officials advised residents to shield their faces with a scarf, bandanna or other covering when leaving their homes. ","1568349320","6"
"967","Dr. Soe-Lin said she didn’t understand why public health officials have been so reluctant to recommend nonmedical fabric masks for the public. Even if they aren’t as protective as a medical mask, they are better than nothing, she said.","1568349320","6"
"968","“We are in the upswing of a pandemic,” Dr. Soe-Lin said. “These cloth masks are protective. It’s a really important complement to the social-distance and hand-washing instructions.”","1568349320","6"
"969","The highest-quality, most expensive medical masks — called N95 respirator masks — should be reserved for hospital workers and emergency responders who are regularly exposed to high viral loads from infected patients, both from frequent contact as well as medical procedures that can spew tiny viral particles into air.","1568349320","6"
"970","If you’re not a health care worker and you have a stash of N95 masks or standard surgical masks, consider donating it to a hospital.","1568349320","6"
"971","If you’re staying home and nobody in your family is infected, you don’t need a mask most of the time. Studies of mask use to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses, including SARS, another form of coronavirus, show a simple mask can lower risk of infection. The effect is greatest when masks are used along with hand hygiene and social distancing.","1568349320","6"
"972","“I think the vast amount of data would suggest that the coronavirus is an airborne infection carried by respiratory droplets, and it also can be passed on by direct contact,” said Dr. Mukherjee, who recently wrote an article about how the coronavirus behaves inside patients. “The mask works two ways — not only to protect you from me, but me from you.”","1568349320","6"
"973","If you decide to start wearing a mask, you should know that it takes some getting used to. A mask can be hot and uncomfortable and fog your glasses if you wear them. But pulling it up and down defeats the purpose of wearing it.","1568349320","6"
"974","While we don’t have a lot of research on the effectiveness of homemade masks in preventing the spread of infection, scientists who study airborne diseases can offer some guidance. A mask sewn from a pattern or an improvised face covering made with a T-shirt probably offers some protection. The thicker the fabric, the better: think heavy cotton T-shirt or a thick, felt-like fabric, said Dr. Marr, the Virginia Tech aerosol scientist.","1568349320","6"
"975","“I’ve been saying some protection is better than none,” said Dr. Marr, who noted that local health departments had been asking aerosol scientists for guidance on potential mask materials to deal with supply shortages. She said her team would have results soon with more specific recommendations for materials to use in masks.","1568349320","6"
"976","Dr. Soe-Lin said she believed an added benefit of a mask was that it serves as a constant reminder against touching your face, a major way that the virus is spread. But no face covering, whether it’s homemade or a medical mask, makes you invincible. Pulling a mask on and off or fidgeting with it will lessen its effectiveness. And in theory, fiddling with your mask could contaminate it. Always remove a mask by the ear loops or the tie — never the part that covers your face.","1568349320","6"
"977","Dr. Soe-Lin said she had used cloth masks for three weeks and washed and dried them regularly. Someone with only one mask can hand wash at night and let it air dry. If a mask gets wet or damp while you are wearing it, it’s less effective, she said.","1568349320","6"
"978","Other experts said worries that fabric masks won’t offer enough protection were misguided.","1568349320","6"
"979","“I don’t think there is any evidence that this is going to make things worse, but there is evidence that it provides some additional good,” said Robert Hecht, professor at the Yale School of Public Health, who was the co-author of the face mask article with Dr. Soe-Lin. “Under this emergency situation we’re in, it seems, in our view, hard to argue against covering your face. We have large numbers of infections occurring which don’t need to happen if people were to use the masks.”","1568349320","6"

If it was not flu, he could think about going home. He put on a mask before the doctor examined him and learned that his heart rate was elevated, which did not surprise him: He could feel the palpitations. He got a flu and a strep test and asked for a Covid-19 test as well, only because they might as well be exhaustive; but the doctor told him he did not have the test, and neither of them thought much about it after that.","1569327635","6"
"1007","The next morning, March 3, not long after his CT scan, a nurse came to give him a Covid-19 test. The nurse was wearing full personal protective equipment, which typically includes eye protection, a respirator mask, gloves, a long gown and a head cap. The hospital had not tested him earlier because the C.D.C. guidelines at the time suggested that testing should be reserved for those who had recently traveled to China or come into close contact with someone believed to have the virus. Cai had not been there for years and to his knowledge had not been in contact with anyone who had tested positive. Now he thought they were just being thorough.","1569327635","6"
"1008","The medical offices where Cai worked had put up a sign directing patients with a cough or fever to wear a mask, and to self-quarantine for two weeks if they had traveled recently to China. Cai never failed to wear a mask and gloves at the office. And yet he still did not see the virus as an imminent threat: He made plans to attend a medical conference and took the subway around the city to his various offices without wearing any protection. He and some of his Chinese-American friends, most of them first-generation, wore masks in public starting in January, reminded that it was a common-sense precaution by the devastating news from Wuhan. But then, in early February, a video ran on the local news showing a man violently attacking an Asian woman who was wearing a mask near a subway turnstile in downtown Manhattan. Cai — and many of his friends — stopped wearing them.","1569327635","6"
"1009","Cai had never felt more alone. He repeatedly called for the nurse, and when she arrived, he spoke as harshly as he ever had to a fellow medical professional. “I am not going to sleep until I see a respiratory therapist,” he told her. He wanted closer monitoring; and he wanted the expert care of someone who could provide a higher level of oxygen dispersal. He dropped Chen’s name, even though he knew the name likely meant nothing to the nurse; he reminded the nurse that he was a physician assistant and could judge for himself his risk. Finally, at around midnight, a respiratory therapist arrived with a Venturi mask, providing a treatment that was not as powerful as high-flow but that still provided higher concentrations of oxygen than Cai had been getting. The therapist also took blood for a test that would assess Cai’s lung functioning.","1569327635","6"

He left it behind. Someone would throw it away and clean the room, and another patient would take his place.","1569327635","6"
"1011","2. The U.S. is experiencing its first days under a federal recommendation that people wear cloth masks in public.","1569327613","6"
"1012","Even as President Trump announced the recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday, he disavowed it. “Wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens — I don’t know,” he said, though he stopped receiving foreign dignitaries weeks ago. “Somehow, I just don’t see it for myself.” [Watch the video.] ","1569327613","6"
"1013","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has posted a no-sew mask pattern using a bandanna and a coffee filter as well as a video on making masks using rubber bands and folded fabrics found at home.","1569516697","6"
"1014","While a simple face covering can reduce the spread of coronavirus by blocking outgoing germs from coughs or sneezes of an infected person, experts say there is more variation in how much homemade masks might protect the wearer from incoming germs, depending on the fit and quality of the material used.","1569516697","6"
"1015","If you don’t have any of the materials that were tested, a simple light test can help you decide whether a fabric is a good candidate for a mask.","1569516697","6"
"1016","“Hold it up to a bright light,” said Dr. Scott Segal, chairman of anesthesiology at Wake Forest Baptist Health who recently studied homemade masks. “If light passes really easily through the fibers and you can almost see the fibers, it’s not a good fabric. If it’s a denser weave of thicker material and light doesn’t pass through it as much, that’s the material you want to use.”","1569516697","6"
"1017","Researchers say it’s important to remember that lab studies are conducted under perfect conditions with no leaks or gaps in the mask, but the test methods give us a way to compare materials. And while the degree of filtration for some homemade masks seems low, most of us — who are staying home and practicing social distancing in public — don’t need the high level of protection required for medical workers. More important, any face covering is better than none, especially if worn by a person who has the virus but doesn’t know it.","1569516697","6"
"1018","The biggest challenge of choosing a homemade mask material is to find a fabric that is dense enough to capture viral particles, but breathable enough that we can actually wear it. Some items being touted online promise high filtration scores, but the material would be unwearable.","1569516697","6"
"1019","To test everyday materials, scientists are using methods similar to those used to test medical masks, which everybody agrees should be saved for medical workers who are exposed to high doses of virus from seeing infected patients. The best medical mask — called the N95 respirator — filters out at least 95 percent of particles as small as 0.3 microns. By comparison, a typical surgical mask — made using a rectangular piece of pleated fabric with elastic ear loops — has a filtration efficiency ranging from 60 to 80 percent.","1569516697","6"
"1020","The problem with air filters is that they potentially could shed small fibers that would be risky to inhale. So if you want to use a filter, you need to sandwich the filter between two layers of cotton fabric.

"1021","If you are lucky enough to know a quilter, ask them to make you a mask. Tests performed at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C., showed good results for homemade masks using quilting fabric. Dr. Segal, of Wake Forest Baptist Health, who led the study, noted that quilters tend to use high-quality, high-thread count cotton. The best homemade masks in his study were as good as surgical masks or slightly better, testing in the range of 70 to 79 percent filtration. Homemade masks that used flimsier fabric tested as low as 1 percent filtration, Dr. Segal said.","1569516697","6"
"1022","The best-performing designs were a mask constructed of two layers of high-quality, heavyweight “quilter’s cotton,” a two-layer mask made with thick batik fabric, and a double-layer mask with an inner layer of flannel and outer layer of cotton.","1569516697","6"
"1023","Bonnie Browning, executive show director for the American Quilter’s Society, said that quilters prefer tightly woven cottons and batik fabrics that stand up over time.

"1025","People who don’t sew could try a folded origami mask, created by Jiangmei Wu, assistant professor of interior design at Indiana University. Ms. Wu, who is known for her breathtaking folded artwork, said she began designing a folded mask out of a medical and building material called Tyvek, as well as vacuum bags, after her brother in Hong Kong, where mask wearing is common, suggested it. (DuPont, the maker of Tyvek, said in a statement that Tyvek is intended for medical apparel, not masks.) The folded mask pattern is free online, as is a video demonstrating the folding process. In tests at Missouri University and University of Virginia, scientists found that vacuum bags removed between 60 percent and 87 percent of particles. But some brands of vacuum bags may contain fiberglass or are harder to breathe through than other materials, and shouldn’t be used. Ms. Wu used a bag by EnviroCare Technologies, which has said it does not use fiberglass in its paper and synthetic cloth bags.","1569516697","6"

"1061","The statue stands in a park across from Mystic Pizza, the restaurant made famous by the eponymous movie starring Julia Roberts. Burfoot and his wife, Cristina, thought putting a mask on Kelley, who was a beloved coach at Fitch High School in Groton, Conn., was a cute way to send the message that runners cared about good health and that everyone else ought to as well.

The more efficient masks like the N95 respirators “are to protect someone who’s going into a room with a person who has the disease, and they’re doing a procedure that’s going to make the virus go into the air, so you have a much higher risk — you’re in a completely different situation than if you’re just going outside walking around.”","1573716231","6"

"1101","If you’re not convinced that you should be wearing a face mask, consider this. An estimated 25 percent of people who have coronavirus don’t know it.

If you sew, choose a tight-woven cotton fabric (flannel is great!) and follow the simple pattern we published. You can also watch the Surgeon General’s no-sew mask video, but don’t use a bandanna as he suggests — they do the worst on materials tests. I don’t sew, so I’ve turned to Etsy and ordered several masks to try.

After dinner, he gave the wire, scissors and a yardstick to four of his five daughters — Suetta, Mabel, Joanne, and Linda — and told them to cut seven-inch lengths for the masks’ nose clips. Then Mr. Troyer, Keim’s sales director, used his work cell — a flip phone whose ringtone plays “Amazing Grace” — to relay to others in the community that the hospital in Cleveland needed thousands of masks immediately.","1573861325","6"
"1115","Rosie Troyer, Mr. Troyer’s wife, told Mr. Miller, “We’re not going to sew any, because my husband still works. We’re giving these to people who don’t have a job.” Mr. Troyer, who does not drive, jumped into Mr. Miller’s car. The pandemic had financially wounded Amish families to such an extent that, within one two-mile stretch, they dropped off mask-making kits at eight homes.","1573861325","6"
"1116","Each kit contains materials for 500 masks “and a warning that says ‘The Surgeon General of the United States has said that you have to wear a mask when you’re making these,’” Mr. Miller said. “So the first thing you do is sew one to wear.”","1573861325","6"
"1117","With raw materials difficult to secure, Amish seamstresses came up with a more efficient mask design. Mr. Miller met a clinic manager at the nearby Akron-Canton Airport, laying samples of the new mask on the hood of her Mazda for approval.","1573861325","6"

"1142","Overnight, masks have become a symbol of social responsibility. If you still need convincing, here’s why you now should be wearing a mask in public spaces to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.","1574819678","6"
"1143","An estimated 25 percent of people with coronavirus feel perfectly fine and don’t know they are infected and could be contagious. And guess what? You could very well be one of them! That’s why you should wear a mask to protect other people from your stealth germs.","1574819678","6"
"1144","Even a simple mask is very effective at trapping droplets from your coughs and sneezes. A recent study published in Nature from the University of Hong Kong and the University of Maryland asked 111 people, infected with various viral illnesses (influenza, rhinovirus and a more-mild coronavirus), to exhale into a giant funnel. Sometimes their noses and mouths weren’t covered; other times they used a simple, not-particularly-well-fitted mask.","1574819678","6"
"1145","Without the masks, the infected people exhaled contagious droplets and aerosols, tiny particles that linger in the air, about 30 percent of the time they were tested. When the infected patients wore a mask, it blocked nearly 100 percent of viral droplets and some of the aerosol particles.","1574819678","6"
"1146","“If we look at all the results together, we found that masks were able to stop most virus-laden respiratory droplets and some of the virus-laden aerosols,” said Ben Cowling, at the School of Public Health of the University of Hong Kong, and the study’s senior author.","1574819678","6"
"1147","While we know that even a simple mask does a pretty good job of protecting the world from your outgoing germs, experts say there is more variation in how much homemade masks might protect you from incoming germs, depending on the fit and quality of the material used.","1574819678","6"
"1148","But the thing is, you don’t need a super-efficient mask if you’re practicing social distancing and washing your hands. And if you use a fabric with decent filtration potential — like two layers of heavy cotton or flannel — and you wear the mask properly, you increase your chances of avoiding the virus.","1574819678","6"
"1149","The bottom line is that when you practice social distancing, wash your hands and wear a mask during those times when you must leave the house, you are lowering your risk for getting sick.","1574819678","6"
"1150","In parts of Asia, where communities have dealt with serious contagions like SARS and MERS, wearing a mask isn’t considered weird. In fact, it’s expected. The more everyone wears a mask, the more accepted mask wearing will become.","1574819678","6"
"1151","“If everybody has to wear a mask, there’s no stigma,” said Shan Soe-Lin, a lecturer at the Yale Jackson Institute for Global Affairs. “I would like to see it change social norms. In Hong Kong, it’s a good thing to see someone in a mask. If you’re sick, you put a mask on. You’re kind of rude to be coughing without a mask on.","1574819678","6"
"1152","Always wash your hands first. Don’t touch the fabric part of the mask — that’s essentially the germ filter, and you don’t want to spread whatever germs it has trapped. Use the ear loops or ties to secure your mask and to remove it. The coverage area should go from near the bridge of your nose to down under your chin and stretch about halfway or more toward your ears. Pull the ties and loops so that it fits as snugly as possible against your face. If your mask has pleats, the folded side should be down.","1574819678","6"
"1153","The writer Peter Hessler, who recently wrote about life in lockdown in China for The New Yorker, created names for the various ways in which people take breaks from masks while wearing them as a way to explain the right and wrong ways to wear a mask to his daughters. The “holster” is a mask pulled down and resting on the neck. The “flap jack” happens when a person takes one ear loop off to talk on the phone. And then there’s the “low rider.” “This is when you pretend that you are obeying the rules, but actually tug the mask down so that your nostrils are uncovered,” he said. All can make the mask far less effective in protecting against germs.","1574819678","6"
"1154","In theory, fidgeting with a mask could introduce germs to your face, but if you’re touching your face that much, you are greatly increasing the risk of getting sick anyway.","1574819678","6"
"1155","But the real worry about wearing a mask is that you start to believe it’s protecting you more than it really is. Behavioral economists know that when people begin to feel safe, they take more risks. It’s a phenomenon seen when federal regulations first made cars safer with added features like seatbelts, and people responded by driving more recklessly. When doctors wear decontamination gowns, studies show they may become more lax about safety protocols. When communities in Mexico began outdoor mosquito spraying to combat dengue fever, families were less likely to adopt personal prevention practices.","1574819678","6"
"1156","Masks do make us feel safer, but any benefit of wearing a mask will be quickly negated if we lose our resolve about social distancing and hand washing. Don’t start lingering in grocery stores or spending time with friends because you are wearing a mask. A mask alone will not protect you from the coronavirus.","1574819678","6"
"1157","The recommendation is to wear a mask at all times in public spaces because we don’t know who has the virus and who doesn’t. It’s also more socially responsible to wear a mask, even if you’re outside.","1574819678","6"
"1158","In general, outdoor exercise, with or without a mask, seems to be safe, according to most experts. Researchers cautioned that little is known about heavy breathing during aerobic exercise and how it affects viral spread. Phys Ed columnist Gretchen Reynolds has all the suggestions and cautions in Exercising Outdoors With a Face Mask.","1574819678","6"
"1159","Masks should not be worn by children under 2 years of age. But older children often are vectors of contagious illnesses, so teaching them to wear a mask is a good idea.","1574819678","6"
"1160","Teaching a child to wear a mask, however, is easier said than done. Many children are frightened of masks or just don’t like them. Keep working on it. You can try to win a child over with fun characters on the mask, rewards or games. You can also convince them by setting the example yourself (the same concept works when your children see you eat vegetables.) Try turning the mask into a craft project that they can wear proudly.","1574819678","6"
"1161","Mask or no mask, children should never go with you to the grocery store or to run essential errands during the pandemic. Community playgrounds are closed (or should be), so outdoor play should be confined to the back yard. If your children need to play in a public space, go somewhere you can easily keep your distance from other people, like an empty soccer field or a sparsely populated hiking trail so that their refusal to wear a mask doesn’t affect other people.","1574819678","6"

"1163","A mask is only needed in the home if someone is sick. The patient should be confined to a separate room with no or minimal contact with the rest of the household (including pets) and should use a separate bathroom if possible. Both patient and caregiver should wear masks when in contact with each other.","1574819678","6"
"1164","N95 respirator masks: These masks fit tightly to the face and have the highest filtration efficiency, blocking 95 percent of particles of 0.3 microns or larger. An N95 mask protects medical workers who come into contact with high doses of the virus while visiting and carrying out medical procedures on multiple patients. The rest of us don’t need that level of protection, so these masks should be reserved for health care workers only. To learn more about how these masks work, check out this video animation from the Arizona State University Risk Innovation Lab.","1574819678","6"
"1165","Medical masks: These are also in short supply and should be used only by medical workers. Sometimes called surgical masks or procedure masks, these masks are those rectangular shaped coverings (often pleated) that come with elastic ear loops. Medical masks are made of a paper-like nonwoven material, and are often given to a coughing patient waiting to see a doctor. Compared to the N95 mask, a medical mask filters about 60 to 80 percent of particles and, according to the Food and Drug Administration, mostly blocks “large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays or splatter that may contain germs.”","1574819678","6"
"1166","Homemade fabric masks: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends we cover our faces with a scarf or homemade fabric mask when we are in public. The effectiveness of homemade masks varies depending on the fabric used, the style and the fit.","1574819678","6"
"1167","In laboratory tests, some homemade masks did a poor job, while others rivaled the filtration of a medical mask. In another study, 21 people made their own masks out of T-shirts, and researchers compared the homemade masks to medical masks. “Both masks significantly reduced the number of microorganisms expelled by volunteers,” although surgical masks were better, wrote the study authors. In community studies, homemade masks were found to offer some protection during viral outbreaks.","1574819678","6"

"1169","Remember, any face covering is better than no face covering. While some people are experimenting with homemade masks using air filters and vacuum bags, the average person doesn’t need that level of protection if you’re practicing social distancing and leaving the house only for essentials. Given that there is so much variability in fabrics, the best advice is to start with a light test. Hold the fabric or mask up to the light and see how much light gets through. The tighter the weave, the less light you’ll see, and the more protection you’ll get. Test the fabric over your face to make sure you can still breathe through it, though.","1574819678","6"
"1170","Because of a shortage of masks, aerosol scientists around the country have been testing everyday materials to see how well they might work in a homemade mask. Most of the time, they have compared the amount and size of particles filtered to the standard used for medical masks — 0.3 microns. However, an often-cited 2013 study from University of Cambridge used a different standard, testing two layers of materials using particles of about 1 micron. Linsey Marr, an aerosol scientist at Virginia Tech, notes that while the 0.3 micron test is a higher standard, the 1 micron test still can be useful in helping people make decisions about mask materials. “There are probably a lot more viruses in 1 micron droplets/aerosols than in 0.3 micron droplets/aerosols,” said Dr. Marr. “So even if a mask only removes 20% of the droplets/aerosols that are 0.3 microns in size, it probably does better with the 1 micron droplet/aerosols,materials testing.”","1574819678","6"
"1171","Here’s a look at some of the everyday products that have been studied for homemade masks. You can find more information in our story, What’s the Best Material for Mask? ","1574819678","6"
"1172","T-shirts: Most of us have an old T-shirt we could cut up into a no-sew mask. It’s one of the most convenient fabrics to use, but there is a lot of variability in how well T-shirt material performs in lab tests. At the Virginia Tech, a single-layer of an old cotton T-shirt captured 20 percent of particles down to 0.3 microns. It captured 50 percent of particles down to 1 micron. A 2013 University of Cambridge study tested two layers of T-shirt which captured about 70 percent of particles down to 1 micron. ","1574819678","6"
"1173","Cotton quilting fabric: This is the high-thread-count cotton fabric preferred by quilters for its durability. In studies at Wake Forest Baptist Health, masks made with quilting fabric rivaled the filtration efficiency of surgical masks.","1574819678","6"
"1174","Tea towels: Tea towels became a popular source of mask material after an August 2013 study from researchers at University of Cambridge found the material compared well to a medical mask at the 1 micron particle size. The study authors did not note the brand. The towel used was not terry cloth, but the tightly-woven absorbent tea towel variety.","1574819678","6"
"1175","Pillow cases: Pillow cases are a good option for sewers who don’t have other fabric. In the 2013 study, 2 layers of pillow case fabric tested close to the efficiency of a surgical mask at the 1 micron standard, but in a study at Missouri University of Science & Technology, it took four layers of 600-thread-count pillow case material to achieve that level of protection at the 0.3 micron standard.","1574819678","6"
"1176","Flannel pajamas: A two-layer mask of flannel and cotton was one of the best tested in the Wake Forest Baptist study and rivaled the efficiency of a surgical mask","1574819678","6"
"1177","Coffee filters and paper towels: The C.D.C. suggests inserting a coffee filter into your mask for extra protection. Missouri University of Science & Technology scientists found that using three coffee filters made it difficult to breathe. Adding a layer of paper towel in between two layers of fabric could make your homemade mask more efficient. An engineer at an air purifier firm ran his own test and found a single paper towel filters 23 percent of 0.3 microns and two paper towels filtered 33 percent. We added a paper towel to our homemade T-shirt mask.","1574819678","6"
"1178","Filters and vacuum bags: Scientists trying to find effective alternatives for medical workers have cut up layers of air filters and tested HEPA vacuum bags. Both can work quite well, but both have significant downsides. Air filters, when cut up, can release fibers that can be dangerous to inhale, so the filter material should be sandwiched between layers of heavy cotton fabric if used in a mask. Vacuum bags are good filters but not that breathable. Plus, some brands of vacuum bags may contain fiberglass so should not be used to cover your face.","1574819678","6"
"1179","You can find a variety of sewing patterns and no-sew mask ideas online. The U.S. Surgeon General has created a video for an easy no-sew mask.

"1182","Medical masks and N95 masks should be saved for medical workers, but if you have a medical mask, you should know that it was designed for one-time use. However a number of scientists, led by a group at Stanford University, are studying the best way to sanitize masks to extend the life of the personal protective equipment used by medical workers during the current shortage.","1574819678","6"
"1183","The problem is that washing or sanitizing a medical mask will degrade it, making it less effective. Scientists have found that using UV light, heat and humidity or a hydrogen peroxide vapor could work, but the methods are developed for use in hospitals with special equipment and are not for home use. You can learn more in our story about efforts to decontaminate thousands of medical masks. ","1574819678","6"
"1184","“I would be wary of putting them in the oven because of the potential to reach too high a temperature and melt the plastic fibers, thus damaging the mask,” said Linsey Marr, a leading aerosol scientist at Virginia Tech who has been studying ways to extend the life of medical masks. “Studies on other viruses show inactivation at about 150 degrees Fahrenheit, which is lower than many ovens can go. But that’s with high humidity, and the humidity makes a big difference. If you have an oven that can hit 150 degrees and you put a pan of water in there, this could be effective, but nobody has tested the method on this specific virus.”","1574819678","6"
"1185","If you have multiple masks, the best strategy is to rotate use of the masks over several days, which gives time for the virus to die. For medical workers, one strategy is to keep a set of five masks, so they can wear a new mask every day and return to the first mask on the sixth day.","1574819678","6"
"1186","“The safest thing to do might be to put the mask somewhere safely out of reach,” said Dr. Marr. “Over a few days, the viruses should decay. In fact, studies have found that viruses usually decay faster on fabric and other porous materials than on hard materials like steel or plastic.”","1574819678","6"
"1187","It’s much easier to clean a fabric mask than a medical mask. The C.D.C. says fabric masks should be “washed routinely.” The mask experts I spoke with wash theirs daily in a machine or a sink, just using regular laundry soap. You can use the dryer or let it air dry. Although it’s not necessary, you can also go over it with a hot iron for a full assault on any germs that might remain.","1574819678","6"
"1188","Just as with a medical mask, chemicals like bleach or hydrogen peroxide will begin to degrade the fabric fibers, making the mask less effective. Dr. Marr notes that a virus can’t replicate outside the body, and if virus particles have been trapped by the mask, they are pretty well stuck there and will decay or be removed during washing.","1574819678","6"
"1189","“Washing with soap and water should work,” Dr. Marr said. “I throw my cloth mask in the washing machine with the rest of the laundry and dry it on low heat. I would avoid bleach because we know that can degrade fibers. The important thing is to avoid damaging the fibers in the mask.”","1574819678","6"

"1201","Under a sprawling tent near the small town of West Jefferson, employees have spent the recent weeks decontaminating over 30,000 used face masks for doctors and nurses on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic.","1575308268","6"
"1202","Each day, N95 masks collected from more than 100 hospitals, clinics, fire departments and nursing homes are treated for hours with a hydrogen peroxide vapor. Once cleaned, the masks are sent back to the same facilities to be reused.","1575308268","6"
"1203","Automakers, fashion designers, furniture manufacturers, tech companies and other organizations have in recent weeks been rushing to manufacture and distribute new masks — part of a growing and improvised effort to increase the supply.","1575308268","6"
"1204","For Battelle, which usually develops products across a range of disciplines, from robotics to oil drilling, the decontamination project is an attempt to extend the lives of masks that already exist.","1575308268","6"
"1205","Late last month, Battelle was granted emergency authorization by the Food and Drug Administration to expand its decontamination efforts, following pressure from President Trump and Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio. Battelle said its process, what they call the Critical Care Decontamination System, will eventually be able to clean 80,000 masks a day per site, and that each mask can be cleaned up to 20 times before losing effectiveness.","1575308268","6"
"1206","Battelle’s West Jefferson site has since received scores of face coverings, double-bagged and stored in boxes marked with biohazard symbols. Health care networks like OhioHealth and Mercy Health are delivering their used masks by trained couriers. Recently, the chief of a local fire department dropped off masks in person.","1575308268","6"
"1207","Up to 50 boxes, containing thousands of masks, show up every day. The number of boxes is expected “to grow exponentially” as hospitals work out safe collection procedures, said Kevin Sayers, who is helping to oversee the West Jefferson operation. In early April, Gov. DeWine said that Battelle would decontaminate masks for free for two weeks. ","1575308268","6"
"1208","Preparing newly arrived masks for decontamination requires small teams of workers in the tents, each wearing black rubber boots, two layers of gloves, surgical scrubs, a lab coat and a portable, powered air purifying respirator attached to a belt that blows filtered air into a closed hood over the worker’s head.","1575308268","6"
"1209","Each mask is inspected before it is processed; roughly 10 percent are soiled or broken and cannot be decontaminated, according to Mr. Sayers. “We’re seeing a lot of masks right now that have makeup on them,” he said.","1575308268","6"
"1210","When ready to be decontaminated, the masks are brought inside a 1,000-cubic-foot chamber.","1575308268","6"
"1211","Inside the decontamination chamber, the teams position the masks, in batches of 5,000 per cycle, on wire shelves affixed to the chamber’s metal walls, taking care to avoid overlapping.","1575308268","6"
"1212","A contraption known as a vapor phase hydrogen peroxide generator, which looks like a washing machine with two hoses, is then used to circulate the colorless gas into and out of the room. During the first four hours, workers increase the humidity inside the chamber, causing the hydrogen peroxide to collect as condensation on the masks, neutralizing the coronavirus and other contaminants.","1575308268","6"
"1213","Over the next four hours, the gas is flushed out of the room. The teams then re-enter the chamber to inspect the masks and conduct spot tests for harmful levels of residual hydrogen peroxide. They then confirm that chemical indicator cards placed throughout the chamber have changed color — the sign of a successful decontamination.","1575308268","6"
"1214","Before being repackaged and sent back to hospitals, the masks are individually marked with the number of decontamination cycles they have passed through.","1575308268","6"
"1215","Last week, for the first time since the effort began, a mask was submitted for a repeat cleaning. “It was nice to see a mask come back,” Mr. Sayers said. “It means that it has been used multiple times and will continue to be used, instead of being thrown out.”","1575308268","6"
"1216","As more sites start decontaminating masks and more hospitals participate, Mr. Sayers expects Battelle to start accepting deliveries all day and through the night. The organization hopes to win approval to expand its procedure to other types of personal protective equipment, such as face shields and surgical masks.","1575308268","6"
"1217","The Rev. Claudio Del Monte carried the phone, given to him by staff in the Bergamo hospital, along with a small cross and some homemade sanitizer. Instead of his usual cleric’s collar, he wore disposable scrubs, a surgical mask covered with another mask, protective eyewear and a cap over his head. On his chest he had drawn a black cross with a felt pen.","1575308264","6"
"1218","He excused himself from two coronavirus patients he was visiting in the hospital and answered the call. But he already knew what it meant. Minutes later, he arrived at the bedside of an older man he had met days earlier. An oxygen mask now obscured the man’s face, and intensive care staff huddled around his bed.","1575308264","6"
"1219","He said he used the phone or social media when possible to console. But he also said he puts on his mask and other protective gear to visit old people fearing death, often alone.","1575308264","6"
"1220","“I used to be close to a dying person, like a doctor next to the sick,” he said. This time he stayed at the threshold of the door watching the man clutch a tank of oxygen. Father Bernardelli delivered last rites through a mask from outside the door frame.","1575308264","6"
"1221","Last week, he too delivered last rites in a mask from the threshold of a bedroom, this time for a woman in his parish. He added that on Monday morning, he said simple prayers at the Bergamo cemetery during a burial.","1575308264","6"
"1222","The Navy is in the process of testing every sailor on board, with results taking up to 96 hours. On Friday, a 20-year-old sailor who had been tested a few days earlier was still awaiting her results. For now, she spends part of her day cleaning the ship, a task for which she is issued gloves and a mask. With so many members of the crew off the boat, social distancing is easier. But her worries about her own test results are compounded by the concern she has for her family in New York, the current epicenter of the virus, and for her shipmates, including her former captain, who has become a symbol of strength for the crew.","1575330243","6"
"1223","The island needs more protective gear, including N95 masks, said Dr. Thomas Shieh, who leads the nonprofit advocacy Guam Medical Association. “The struggle for supplies is real,” said Shieh, a former naval officer who spent four years at the base hospital before going into private practice.","1575330243","6"

"1225","Critics of the large chains say the companies are not taking the threat seriously enough. Health care workers are concerned about protective equipment, with patients being asked to reuse masks and scattered shortages of the most protective gear for the nurses and technicians dealing with infected patients.","1575398493","6"
"1226","At this juncture, with the highly infectious coronavirus, others are extremely concerned about the spread of the virus through inadequate supplies of special masks or gowns. “We don’t have enough of many of those protective equipments,” Dr. Kliger said.","1575398493","6"
"1227","DaVita and Fresenius have put in place similar measures in recent weeks to try to prevent infections. No one gets into a clinic without a fever check and a discussion about potential coronavirus symptoms. Their patients and employees are now required to wear masks.","1575398493","6"
"1228","Both companies acknowledge concerns over shortages of supplies but say they continue to have enough. Every patient is handed a new mask for each visit, the companies say, and workers have adequate protective equipment.","1575398493","6"
"1229","Kisha Cox, a 45-year-old in Portland, Ore., said she was not particularly anxious about going to the DaVita clinic where she received dialysis. She says she is following the clinic’s new protocols about wearing masks and its advice about being careful to wash her hands.","1575398493","6"
"1230","The Trump administration appeared to be conflicted Thursday about whether to recommend that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public, even as federal health officials were revising guidance to reflect new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms.","1575898858","6"
"1231","Until now, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, like the World Health Organization, has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks, including N95 respirator masks, for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply.","1575898858","6"
"1232","At a White House briefing Thursday evening, President Trump said his administration was “coming out with regulations” on mask wearing but stressed that the guidance would be entirely voluntary. “If people want to wear them, they can,” he said.","1575898858","6"
"1233","According to a federal official, the C.D.C. has been preparing to recommend that everyone wear face coverings in public settings, like pharmacies and grocery stores, to avoid unwittingly spreading the virus. Public health officials have continued to stress, however, that N95 masks and surgical masks should be saved for front-line doctors and nurses, who have been in dire need of protective gear.","1575898858","6"
"1234","For weeks, the administration has sent conflicting messages on masks. At first, officials clearly stated that masks should only be worn by sick people. For some time, Mr. Trump has been saying masks might be useful, but scarves would be fine as well. Chinese officials have expressed alarm at how few ordinary Americans are covering their noses and mouths.","1575898858","6"
"1235","Earlier this week, Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the C.D.C., confirmed in a radio interview that the agency was reviewing its guidelines on who should wear masks. Citing new data that shows high rates of transmission from people who are infected but show no symptoms, he said the guidance on mask wearing was “being critically re-reviewed, to see if there’s potential additional value for individuals that are infected or individuals that may be asymptomatically infected.” ","1575898858","6"
"1236","President Trump took aim on Thursday at the manufacturing giant 3M, which has been increasing production of N95 respirator masks that filter small particles and droplets from the air. ","1575898858","6"
"1237","At a White House briefing earlier in the day, Mr. Trump announced he was invoking the Defense Production Act, a 1950s law, to help shore up dwindling supplies of masks and other supplies. The move came after desperate pleas from governors and health care officials who are trying to handle the spike in patients infected by coronavirus. ","1575898858","6"
"1238","As the virus swept across the country, overwhelming hospitals, 3M had said that it was speeding up production of N95 masks and that it planned to increase output in the United States by 30 percent over the next year. ","1575898858","6"
"1239","The company usually makes about 400 million masks a year. It is unclear what set off President Trump, but his trade adviser, Peter Navarro, made an oblique reference to 3M at the briefing, mentioning that “we’ve had some issues making sure that all of the production that 3M does around the world,” ends up being sent “to the right places.” ","1575898858","6"
"1240","Even as the U.S. grapples with a mask shortage, 3M has continued to sell the critical safety equipment abroad, according to someone with direct knowledge of the matter. It is not illegal for the company to sell its masks to foreign countries. And the U.S. has been slow to respond in a coordinated way or to marshal federal resources, health officials said. That sluggish response has meant that other governments put in orders ahead of the United States. ","1575898858","6"
"1241","The investor Mark Cuban, who is advising Project N95, a new nonprofit group that aims to help American hospitals connect with vetted mask suppliers, speculated that the administration may be upset over a perceived lack of transparency from 3M. ","1575898858","6"
"1242","“Just like we’re seeing shortages of other materials, like masks and ventilators, medications are right there in the mix of things that we don’t always have enough of on hand,” said Erin Fox, a drug shortage expert at the University of Utah. “So we were not prepared for this kind of surge.”","1575898858","6"
"1243","The U.S. government has nearly emptied its emergency stockpile of protective medical supplies like masks, gowns and gloves, a senior official said. Some states receiving desperately needed ventilators from the federal government discovered that the machines did not work.","1575898858","6"
"1244","Three decades later, Moscow got a chance to turn the tables. A giant An-124 Russian military transport plane landed at Kennedy International Airport in New York on Wednesday, bearing cartons of masks and ventilators from Russia for a pandemic-stricken metropolis.","1575898858","6"
"1245","A series of shipments of purchased protective gear for medical workers has been arranged and is expected to funnel much-needed masks, gowns and protective gear to hospitals in the coming weeks to the United States.","1575898858","6"
"1246","Among the many questions raised amid the pandemic is whether healthy people should wear a mask when they’re outside. ","1575898858","6"
"1247","While masks were a common sight across East Asia long before the outbreak — worn for a variety of reasons — the official advice from both the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been that only the sick or their caregivers should wear masks. But those guidelines may be shifting, and some local officials are moving to get in front of a rule change.","1575898858","6"
"1248","Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor, wrote on Twitter on Monday that masks would be handed out at supermarket entrances, and that it was mandatory for shoppers to wear them.","1575898858","6"
"1249","The president of Slovakia, who made waves on social media last month for wearing fashionable face masks that matched her clothes on official engagements, has also made facial protection in public mandatory. Officials in Jena, a city in eastern Germany, said on Monday that protective masks should be worn inside shops and on local transport, among other places.","1575898858","6"
"1250","And in Boston, officials on Thursday awaited the New England Patriots’ team jet, which was hauling 1.2 million masks to the Northeast for use in Massachusetts and New York.","1575898858","6"

"1252","It is enigmatic that many Christians are so loyal to a man who is almost everything Jesus spoke against. As for the pandemic, for those who still believe this is a half-concocted story fueled by a media lynch mob that is overplaying its reality to win back a liberal White House, while I am sure there is political opportunism from both sides, I wish you could put on mask, gown and gloves and enter one of the E.R. rooms. I would invite you to share your political thoughts with the people being put on ventilators left and right.","1575566591","6"
"1253","President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said that on his first day as president, he would ask Americans to wear masks for 100 days. “Just 100 days to mask,” Mr. Biden said in an interview on CNN. “Not forever. 100 days. And I think we’ll see a significant reduction.”","1576148518","6"
"1254","“We want Oaklanders to have space and give our parks a break,” she added, asking that residents wear a mask if they head outside.","1575765235","6"
"1255","There were advertisements for gallons of hand sanitizer, crates of isolation gowns and, most crucially, pallets of N95 masks — perhaps the most sought-after product on the planet. All were for prices that were multiples higher than what she normally paid.","1576454791","6"
"1256","“All of these people are coming out of the woodwork, and all of them mysteriously now have access to an abundant supply,” said Ms. Houghtelling, who works for three hospitals owned by Arnot Health, based in Elmira. She forwarded dozens of messages to The New York Times from brand-new vendors. One offered her boxes of 50 surgical masks for $70 each; she used to pay $2.28.","1576454791","6"
"1257","One solicitor in particular caught her attention: Blank Industries, a company that offered N95 masks for nearly $5 each — and only if Ms. Houghtelling ordered a million. She figured it was a scam.","1576454791","6"
"1258","Blank Industries is a real company, but it’s an ice-melt manufacturer in Hudson, Mass. In an interview, Andrew Blank, the founder, said he had upended his business to sell masks after hearing from a former Chinese supplier he had once hired to make a new kind of toothbrush. (Mr. Blank had invented it.) After the coronavirus hit, the supplier turned his dental-products plant into a mask factory. Mr. Blank told his 12 employees to stop selling rock salt and start selling masks.","1576454791","6"
"1259","The eruption in demand for dwindling amounts of masks has resulted in a kind of global supply-chain bedlam. In the United States, the federal government has decided against commandeering American factories to create a new stream of masks. Instead, federal officials are competing against states, hospitals and medical suppliers for the same pool of masks, which come mostly from China.","1576454791","6"
"1260","That frenzy has created a mess of confusion, according to interviews with hospitals, factories and mask buyers. Production of masks is soaring, but so are scams, logistical hurdles and, of course, prices.","1576454791","6"
"1261","After the coronavirus outbreak began, China imported two billion masks. France ordered a billion and vowed to become self-sufficient by year-end. The U.S. government has done comparatively little to coordinate purchasing and ensure that American governments and hospitals aren’t competing.","1576454791","6"
"1262","Last month, federal officials agreed to buy roughly 600 million N95 masks over the next 18 months. But many states and hospitals are desperate for supplies right now, and the government has already nearly exhausted the supply of protective gear in the national stockpile. On Thursday, the White House said it had invoked the Defense Production Act, a 1950s law, to ensure the manufacturing giant 3M sends a certain share of its masks to the United States.","1576454791","6"
"1263","Some of the entrepreneurs stepping up in the government’s stead have succeeded. Operation Masks, a two-week-old nonprofit run by tech executives, said it had just closed deals for one million N95s for New York State and 200,000 for Hawaii, charging just over $3 for each mask, not including shipping and other costs. On Thursday, Massachusetts received 1.2 million N95 masks via the New England Patriots team plane.","1576454791","6"
"1264","The hospital is prepared to pay more for masks, but it does not want to buy counterfeit gear. “You’re in this uncharted territory where you’re struggling to just at least validate,” Mr. Bonetti said. “The last thing we want to do is put product on a clinician that is not going to protect them.”","1576454791","6"
"1265","Not every new entrant to the market is a good Samaritan. Groups on Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram are teeming with posts hawking thousands of masks at inflated prices.","1576454791","6"
"1266","Some are wholesalers who bought pallets of masks from China or in liquidation sales and then marked them up. Many more are simply middlemen who call themselves brokers. They scour the groups for masks advertised for a relatively low price, and then repost the offer for a few thousand dollars more. They don’t handle the masks or put up their own money.","1576454791","6"
"1267","Yaear Weintroub is one of those brokers. A 22-year-old community college student from Brooklyn, he typically sells wholesale electronics to Amazon sellers. But the online forums he searches for deals became flooded with listings for masks last month, so he now spends his days trying to connect buyers and sellers for a bit of medical-supply arbitrage.","1576454791","6"
"1268","In a recent interview, he said he was working with a partner to close a deal for 280,000 surgical masks that would increase their price 20 percent and net the pair a roughly $40,000 profit. He said many of the brokers sold to other brokers, each one marking up the price, until the masks presumably make it to a nursing home or a hospital. He said he would prefer to sell directly to hospitals.","1576454791","6"
"1269","To these sellers, medical supplies are simply another hot product to flip for a profit. Avraham Eisenberg, a New York wholesaler who is trying to ship masks from China, compared the rush for masks to the fad several years ago for fidget spinners.","1576454791","6"
"1270","The Justice Department said last month that it would investigate people manipulating the medical-supply market. Five days later, federal authorities charged a Brooklyn man with lying about price gouging after he tried to sell 1,000 masks and other supplies to a doctor for $12,000. (He also was charged with assault after he claimed he had the coronavirus and coughed on F.B.I. agents.) Federal officials are now distributing the more than half a million supplies they confiscated from him.","1576454791","6"
"1271","In China, the competition is intense. A small number of Chinese factories are certified by the Food and Drug Administration to make N95 masks, and “those are the diamonds right now,” said Lily Liu, a Chinese hospital executive turned Silicon Valley entrepreneur who now helps run Operation Masks.","1576454791","6"
"1272","That demand has fueled the spike in prices. While some factory owners are probably making handsome margins, much of the price increase is likely spread across the supply chain, from the firms that ship and inspect the masks to those that make the masks’ fabric and the machines that assemble them.","1576454791","6"
"1273","Take Zhou Hua, the owner of a factory in Xuancheng, China, that months ago made children’s clothing. In February, as the coronavirus swept across his country, he rushed to buy mask machines and spent roughly $500,000 transforming his plant. Now his staff has nearly doubled to 75 employees, and they make 1.6 million masks a day.","1576454791","6"
"1274","He said his margins were modest, and blamed higher material costs for much of the price increases. Most masks use melt-blown fabric to stop tiny particles. Mr. Zhou said the price of that material had risen 90 percent to about $53 a ton. He added that the price for machines that weld straps to the masks had tripled, to roughly $2,100.","1576454791","6"
"1275","The people jumping into the mask market come from across the spectrum. Dan Schonfeld, for instance, sells pool noodles. He’s pretty good at it, too. He found a reliable supplier in China, slapped sports teams’ logos on them and built a steady business through PoolPartsToGo.com.","1576454791","6"
"1276","When the coronavirus spread last month to his home state, New York, Mr. Schonfeld thought he could use his connections in China to get masks to American doctors. He dropped his pool-supply business and began pursuing masks, vowing not to earn a cent.","1576454791","6"
"1277","He worked his iPhone around the clock, calling American hospitals by day and Chinese contacts by night. The hospitals were all interested, but reliable masks were in short supply.","1576454791","6"
"1278","Then, just before midnight on March 19, his pool-noodle supplier in Ningbo, China, Jensen Jiang, emailed with news. He had secured a deal with a nearby factory for 100,000 N95 masks at $2.70 each. But competing orders were coming in, he said, so Mr. Schonfeld had to decide quickly.","1576454791","6"
"1279","The next day, Mr. Schonfeld excitedly called the hospitals. But executives who had expressed such desperation for masks were suddenly wary of turning over $270,000 to a man who was selling pool parts just days before. One replied “We just don’t know you,” Mr. Schonfeld said. “It turned into me needing help.”","1576454791","6"
"1280","Then he awoke to more bad news. “I am afraid that I made big trouble to you,” Mr. Jiang said in a March 26 email. “All the masks were taken by government.” The email included a photo of a closure notice on the factory’s doors, dated 11 days earlier. Mr. Schonfeld didn’t know what to believe.","1576454791","6"
"1281","As Mr. Jiang negotiated a refund, which still hasn’t arrived, they decided to find and ship a different mask: the so-called KN95, China’s effective version of the N95. Mr. Schonfeld ordered 150,000 from a new factory and booked a freight plane for April 3.","1576454791","6"
"1282","But then there was another catch: The F.D.A.’s guidelines for medical use of KN95 masks in the United States were murky, and Mr. Schonfeld’s lawyers warned that officials could seize them. (On April 2, the agency said it would not block imports of the masks.)","1576454791","6"
"1283","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has posted a no-sew mask pattern using a bandanna and a coffee filter as well as a video on making masks using rubber bands and folded fabrics found at home.","1576609428","6"
"1284","While a simple face covering can reduce the spread of coronavirus by blocking outgoing germs from coughs or sneezes of an infected person, experts say there is more variation in how much homemade masks might protect the wearer from incoming germs, depending on the fit and quality of the material used.","1576609428","6"
"1285","If you don’t have any of the materials that were tested, a simple light test can help you decide whether a fabric is a good candidate for a mask.","1576609428","6"
"1286","“Hold it up to a bright light,” said Dr. Scott Segal, chairman of anesthesiology at Wake Forest Baptist Health who recently studied homemade masks. “If light passes really easily through the fibers and you can almost see the fibers, it’s not a good fabric. If it’s a denser weave of thicker material and light doesn’t pass through it as much, that’s the material you want to use.”","1576609428","6"
"1287","Researchers say it’s important to remember that lab studies are conducted under perfect conditions with no leaks or gaps in the mask, but the test methods give us a way to compare materials. And while the degree of filtration for some homemade masks seems low, most of us — who are staying home and practicing social distancing in public — don’t need the high level of protection required for medical workers. More important, any face covering is better than none, especially if worn by a person who has the virus but doesn’t know it.","1576609428","6"
"1288","The biggest challenge of choosing a homemade mask material is to find a fabric that is dense enough to capture viral particles, but breathable enough that we can actually wear it. Some items being touted online promise high filtration scores, but the material would be unwearable.","1576609428","6"
"1289","To test everyday materials, scientists are using methods similar to those used to test medical masks, which everybody agrees should be saved for medical workers who are exposed to high doses of virus from seeing infected patients. The best medical mask — called the N95 respirator — filters out at least 95 percent of particles as small as 0.3 microns. By comparison, a typical surgical mask — made using a rectangular piece of pleated fabric with elastic ear loops — has a filtration efficiency ranging from 60 to 80 percent.","1576609428","6"
"1290","The problem with air filters is that they potentially could shed small fibers that would be risky to inhale. So if you want to use a filter, you need to sandwich the filter between two layers of cotton fabric. Dr. Wang said one of his grad students made his own mask by following the instructions in the C.D.C. video, but adding several layers of filter material inside a bandanna.","1576609428","6"
"1291","If you are lucky enough to know a quilter, ask them to make you a mask. Tests performed at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C., showed good results for homemade masks using quilting fabric. Dr. Segal, of Wake Forest Baptist Health, who led the study, noted that quilters tend to use high-quality, high-thread count cotton. The best homemade masks in his study were as good as surgical masks or slightly better, testing in the range of 70 to 79 percent filtration. Homemade masks that used flimsier fabric tested as low as 1 percent filtration, Dr. Segal said.","1576609428","6"

"1293","Bonnie Browning, executive show director for the American Quilter’s Society, said that quilters prefer tightly woven cottons and batik fabrics that stand up over time.

"1295","People who don’t sew could try a folded origami mask, created by Jiangmei Wu, assistant professor of interior design at Indiana University. Ms. Wu, who is known for her breathtaking folded artwork, said she began designing a folded mask out of a medical and building material called Tyvek, as well as vacuum bags, after her brother in Hong Kong, where mask wearing is common, suggested it. (DuPont, the maker of Tyvek, said in a statement that Tyvek is intended for medical apparel, not masks.) The folded mask pattern is free online, as is a video demonstrating the folding process. In tests at Missouri University and University of Virginia, scientists found that vacuum bags removed between 60 percent and 87 percent of particles. But some brands of vacuum bags may contain fiberglass or are harder to breathe through than other materials, and shouldn’t be used. Ms. Wu used a bag by EnviroCare Technologies, which has said it does not use fiberglass in its paper and synthetic cloth bags.","1576609428","6"
"1296","“I wanted to create an alternative for people who don’t sew,” said Ms. Wu, who said she is talking to various groups to find other materials that will be effective in a folded mask. “Given the shortage of all kinds of materials, even vacuum bags might run out.”","1576609428","6"

"1320","But for some children, even the humblest of masks can be scary — scary in themselves, and scary as reminders of the threat of infection, and the generally frightening times through which we are living. There are children who find Halloween frightening, children who hate clowns, children who react badly to anyone without a standard human face. Roberto Olivardia, a lecturer in psychology at Harvard Medical School, said that as many as 1 percent of children may suffer from “maskaphobia,” a fear that persists for longer than six months, usually thought of in relation to costumes and superheroes.","1576849452","6"
"1321","But for many children, seeing their parents wearing masks as they come and go, or going outside, even with full social distancing, in a world where most people are wearing masks, can be disconcerting, frightening or just one more source of sadness.","1576849452","6"
"1322","One reason children may find masks disconcerting is that the ability to recognize — and read — faces is much weaker in young children than it will be by adolescence. A while ago, when I wrote about this ability, I spoke with Kang Lee, a professor of applied psychology and human development at the University of Toronto, who studies the development of facial recognition skills in children.","1576849452","6"
"1323","I reached out to him again to think about how the face masks we are now seeing everywhere might appear to preschoolers.","1576849452","6"
"1324","As adults, Dr. Lee said, we look at faces as a whole: “If you wear a mask, I can still recognize you, even though half of your face is covered, I can still recognize the structure of your face.”","1576849452","6"
"1325","He explained that children younger than 6 tend to pay attention to individual features, rather than recognizing the person as a whole. “For example, they pay attention to the size of the nose, or the shape of the eye.” Studies in which children were asked to look at pictures in which faces were partially blocked off show that they may have trouble recognizing even familiar faces when some of those features were not fully visible. So friends and neighbors — seen from a distance — who are wearing masks may look more unfamiliar to children than they do to adults.","1576849452","6"
"1326","For parents who are starting to wear masks, she said, “Put it on, put it off a few times, so the child sees it’s still daddy.”","1576849452","6"
"1327","And by putting on masks, she said, we’ve taken away some of that information — and made it especially difficult for children to read emotional signals, which is, again, unsettling and disconcerting. So if you are wearing a mask, make sure to explain yourself very clearly to your child, giving directions, telling the child if there’s a problem. Dr. Olivardia said that children with autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and social anxiety may be particularly vulnerable here.","1576849452","6"
"1328","Dr. Harold Koplewicz, the president of the Child Mind Institute, which has extensive coronavirus resources for parents, said, “I think it’s important to explain to kids that people are wearing masks as a way to help others — otherwise they assume it’s because they’re dangerous.” Children should think of this as an act of social responsibility, he said, and it might help to compare it to washing hands, as something you do to keep yourself safe, but also to help protect others.","1576849452","6"
"1329","“It is important to first validate that it can be uncomfortable when we don’t know what or who is behind a mask,” Dr. Olivardia said in an email. “You can have a child wear their own mask, even a scary one, and recognize that they can be perceived as scary despite being a nice person.”","1576849452","6"
"1330","For treating phobias, psychologists often rely on exposure therapy, and Dr. Christopher Willard, a psychologist in Cambridge, Mass., who is the author of “The Breathing Book,” suggested that parents try an informal version with masks. “Pick fun fabric, let kids design them for themselves and their parents, make it a craft activity and also a game,” he wrote in an email. “Practice taking them on and off and wearing them around the house for fun, but also taking it off, try to read each other’s facial expressions with just eyes while a mask is on,” he suggested. “These kinds of things normalize it a bit and make it less scary.”","1576849452","6"
"1331","Dr. Willard suggested that it could help children to make a superhero connection, explaining that doctors and nurses are heroes protecting and helping other people, and masks are part of their uniforms. “We too can be superheroes and protect other people from germs by wearing these masks for a while,” he wrote.","1576849452","6"

"1361","We are weeks away from the full impact of this outbreak, but we are already trying to conserve masks, gowns and face shields. Because of how infectious the virus is and the country’s lack of preparation and equipment, the decision to intervene is a question not only of how to apportion tangible supplies, but also of how to best distribute risk among health care workers. I want to do everything for my patients, as much as they and their families want, just as we have always done. But what do I owe future patients? What do I owe my colleagues? As I look at my team of doctors and nurses and consider our next steps, I think of a recent Facebook post from one of my supervising physicians, who trained me during residency, William Binder, who is now in his 60s. “As an emergency physician, I understand anything can happen to anyone at any time, but I have never felt exposed nor susceptible,” he wrote. “The coronavirus has stripped away my veneer of invincibility.”","1577660307","6"
"1362","It seems impossible to avoid getting infected. You would have to be perfect, and in the mayhem of the E.R., it’s nearly impossible to be even good. I make mental calculations to keep all protective equipment on for my eight-hour shifts; during my 12-hour shifts, I’ll remove it only twice, to eat or drink. Two Italian colleagues — a doctor and a nurse — have already warned me about the physical toll of wearing this equipment on their aching faces, their noses rubbed raw, the tracing of their masks etched into their skin.","1577660307","6"
"1363","We’re temporarily out of the proper disinfectant wipes at the E.R. in one of our hospitals. Someone intubates two patients — a procedure that risks exposing the medical worker to discharge from a patient’s nose and mouth — without a face shield because none were immediately available. A co-worker is collaborating with others to 3-D-print face shields. Emails come through from hospital leadership and the city’s health department telling us to be “appropriate” and conserve our N95 masks. A physician assistant is baking her masks in the oven to sterilize them. She shares her recipe: 170 degrees for 30 minutes. Others spray theirs down with Lysol after every shift. I was shocked when they told us to use these single-use masks for the whole day; now we are told they must last multiple shifts. We can discard them only if they become visibly soiled. Otherwise, wear the same one — “for multiple patients, for multiple shifts.” How am I supposed to know when a mask should be thrown out? What does a virus particle look like, anyway? I start telling my residents that it’s better to be lucky than to be good.","1577660307","6"
"1364","One colleague, who is over 60, already has a plan if she feels ill. She’ll check her oxygen measurement, and if it’s less than normal, she’ll consult an outbreak map online and survey the surrounding states. She’ll pick the closest city with the smallest number of cases. Then she’ll drive there and hope that her age won’t be considered when it comes to the care she gets. I find out that more doctors are hospitalized with the virus. One E.R. colleague across town is intubated. I get texts from colleagues across the country about doctors who are infected and hospitalized, some in the I.C.U., some intubated. I look at my reused mask. It doesn’t seem soiled yet. I put it back on my face. Better to be lucky than to be good, I tell myself.","1577660307","6"
"1365","When I walk through the hospital doors, the E.R. is a place I no longer recognize. Intubated patients, of every age, are on ventilators everywhere. It feels simultaneously electrifying and oppressive. But it’s also eerily quiet. Family members and friends haven’t been allowed into the E.R. for more than a week; most of the patients are too sick to talk; the few without breathing tubes who are able to cough are muffled by their masks. Oxygen hisses in the background. A couple of hours into my shift, one of the nurses comes to me. She falls apart, tears streaming down her inflamed, marked cheeks. She sobs out words of anger and frustration and sadness. The morning, on top of the last several days, has crushed her. I want to hug her, but I can’t.","1577660307","6"
"1366","A co-worker tells me he used three masks during the course of his shift. Three masks?! I respond. That’s crazy! Then I realize I am the absurd one. The masks are meant for single use, one per patient encounter; my colleague had used three masks over a 12-hour shift, most likely having seen upward of 30 patients who potentially have Covid. It’s idiotic that I was shocked by his using three masks, especially when many of our co-workers in the city have fallen ill.","1577660307","6"
"1367","When I get to work the next day, a patient who had a breathing tube inserted overnight had woken up enough to pull it out. She was delirious, lacking oxygen to her brain, and had also yanked out her IV lines. Sputum and blood and sweat are flying everywhere in the room. My instinct is to run in to help, but I force myself to pause, put on all the equipment. I place the N95 respirator on my face — and a surgical mask over the N95 to keep it clean and reusable, as we’re instructed — as well as a gown, goggles, gloves and a face shield, 3-D-printed by my colleague. It’s so hot. I start sweating immediately. We manage to reinsert her breathing tube and replace her IV lines; she safely makes it to the I.C.U. After an hour working like this, I feel lightheaded, but it is too early to remove the mask and drink water. How do I make it through the next 12 hours?","1577660307","6"
"1368","Six hours into my shift, I go to the bathroom for the first time. I stand in the unvented bathroom for a minute and pull my mask away from my face. The air is stale, but the rush of oxygen into my lungs feels wonderful. I take big gulps of it through my nostrils before letting the mask compress my face again. When I’m not in the hospital, I feel a phantom mask on my face. I wake from sleep trying to adjust it, thinking it’s still on.","1577660307","6"
"1369","At so many points I ask myself, Does it even matter anymore? It feels like the virus is everywhere, breathing on all the surfaces, exhaling itself into the atmosphere. It feels exhausting wearing one mask all day and covering it with another to keep it clean, having to think so much about not getting it soiled and wondering if I accidentally contaminate the inside of it when I hold it away from my face to breathe for a minute or take it off to chug water. Sometimes I see the individual virus particles — round with red, protruding crown-shaped spikes, like the C.D.C.’s rendering — everywhere in the hospital, on beds and monitors and phones and computers. I shudder, forcing myself to erase the image from my mind.","1577660307","6"
"1370","By the end of my shift, every patient begins to blend into a single patient. “Fever and cough,” “fever and cough and shortness of breath,” “cough and trouble breathing,” “sent by doctor’s office for Covid rule-out,” “sent from urgent care for Covid test.” I can’t even keep track of them anymore. Usually I remember patients by their faces, but they all have masks on too, so all I see is their eyes, which more often than not are closed.","1577660307","6"
"1371","We’re unable to reliably predict who does well and who doesn’t. Old or young, all seem wholly vulnerable. Politicians, epidemiologists, even doctors have been saying that people in their 20s and 30s who get sick already have medical problems or are obese, but then, right after I hear that, I need to put a young and fit patient on a ventilator. The virus is impulsive, attacking one person more ferociously than another. I feel the compression from all sides — the I.C.U. is full, the E.R. is full — I just don’t see the end of this in sight. When I think about that, I feel submerged, and my instinct is to rip off my mask and leave the hospital. Then I try to convince myself that it’s like running. When you start off, your lungs burn and your legs ache, but as your stride hits a rhythm, you start to feel good, and you know you can go on for miles. I hope intensely for that moment to come soon.","1577660307","6"
"1372","The first patient hospitalized in New York is finally discharged, nearly a month after his diagnosis. Many have died in the meantime, and many more are uncounted in the ­Covid-19 death toll because they succumbed at home or weren’t tested. Some others wait days in the E.R. for an inpatient bed, languishing in hallways. Their fates remain unknown. I pass by them when I first arrive at the E.R. and when I leave at the end of the day. Sometimes they are still there the next day. If they are awake, I’m hesitant to make eye contact. I’m too ashamed that after nearly 15 years as a doctor, I can’t do much more for them except put an oxygen mask over their nose and mouth.","1577660307","6"
"1373","One day I see a grandfatherly man, who speaks softly and smiles sweetly, come in with oxygen numbers dipping as low as 75 percent. He feels good, he says, and his breathing is fine. Just a little tired, don’t worry, he says. Despite everything I know so far, I think he will do OK because he looks so well. The next day, when I return to the E.R., I see he is now confused. Even wearing an oxygen mask, he could not sustain levels above 90 percent overnight. He had previously decided that he did not want extraordinary measures taken to save his life; he did not want to be on a breathing machine. His family, over the phone, is clear about his wishes, so we make him comfortable with morphine.","1577660307","6"
"1374","A few days ago, palliative-care doctors started helping us with some of the life-or-death conversations. They call families and talk to them about procedures that patients might have to undergo if they want to escalate the interventions; these doctors help figure out where the limits should be drawn. They also explain how patients could otherwise be made comfortable, if they don’t want to continue with more aggressive treatments. But the doctors are soon overloaded, unable to tend to all the consultations. I try to do what I can. An 89-year-old patient is brought in by ambulance, with an oxygen mask covering most of her small face. I don’t think she’ll be able to talk, but she is actually able to express herself and tell me: “I don’t want a breathing tube. I’m almost 90 years old. I’ve lived.” She’s originally from North Carolina, she says. I call her niece, who is her health care proxy. She conferences in other family members. “Well, can’t we overrule what she wants?” one of them asks me.","1577660307","6"
"1375","I happened to have been assigned to work at one hospital for a chain of shifts, so I hadn’t been inside one of our other hospitals in over a week. As soon as I open the E.R. doors there, I shrink from the sights and smells. Patients are now triple-bunked into single-person spaces, curtains pushed aside. In one room, three men, who appear to be in their 80s or so, are side by side in their stretchers, each one pulling at his oxygen mask, confused, their frail limbs swinging in the air. Some have sat in their own feces for a day. Puddles of urine have pooled around the wheels of some patients’ stretchers. Nurses are out sick; the remaining ones are coping the best they can. I have gotten texts from colleagues about the chaos here, but I thought that those were just about one bad day, that they had already gone through the worst.","1577660307","6"

Once he was safely in his bedroom, she called the Yale Covid-19 call center for guidance on what to do next. By then the first case of Covid-19 in Connecticut had been reported, a few days earlier on March 8. Given his likely exposure at school and his fever there and now at home, her son met the criteria of someone who should be tested, she was told.

The masked nurse returned with news from the E.D. doctor: He was to be admitted. They would test him for Covid-19.

She wiped everything down with disinfectant before she brought it into the house and left her coat and shoes in the foyer. She washed her hands dozens of times a day and scrubbed her counters and keyboards before and after every use. She was caring for her 91-year-old mother, who lived just a block away, and was terrified that the family matriarch would get sick.

"1462","On April 10, the television anchor George Stephanopoulos went to a pharmacy in East Hampton, N.Y., wearing a mask and gloves, nine days after his wife, the actress Ali Wentworth, revealed she had tested positive for the coronavirus.","1580372483","6"
"1463","Mr. Stephanopoulos, 59, an anchor of the show, said that he was taking care to protect himself. “I’m definitely being careful in wiping down and wearing gloves,” he said. “I have not been wearing a mask.”","1580372483","6"

"1470","One act of kindness that I’ve been participating in is making masks with my mom and selling them to people for very low prices. We go to stores and buy certain fabrics and materials either with designs or no designs and make them into beautiful masks. Recently we’ve been selling them to workers and they have said some very nice comments towards the masks and our dedication to helping people. Another thing I do is deliver the masks to people around our neighborhood that can’t go outside so I just suit up put on my mask and gloves and head out and I can say that this has brought much joy to me especially when I know that I’m using my time well and not sitting around playing video games all day.","1580437606","6"
"1471","I’ve heard of many people sewing masks out of their materials and decontaminating them. They then can safely distribute them to people in their community to use less surgical masks that are in high demand and needed in hospitals. I think this is useful because it can also encourage people who may be sick to wear masks while they are out while simultaneously saving resources that are needed by health care workers. It’s something people can do in the safety of their homes to help their community.","1580437606","6"
"1472","As the world is going through a pandemic, our school decided to send a care package to three different hospitals in South Korea (that is where I live).

During easter our family and some other people brought masks and gave it to others in need.","1580437606","6"

"1485","One imagines how the governor might describe the act of wearing a mask as the days stretch on: You’re going to forget to not touch it, you’re going to accidentally pull it down to speak, you’re going to hate the way it smells, you’re going to have to use a passcode to unlock your phone, you’re going to fog up your glasses. But you have to wear it in those situations.","1581497980","6"
"1486","Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania are requiring that masks be worn in stores; likewise in Los Angeles and some surrounding California counties.

"1492","Once, a person wearing a mask in public stood out. But now, it’s the other way around.

You can tell because they’re huffing and puffing.”","1581497980","6"
"1494","Many New Yorkers sought a relationship with the mask that seemed most sensible. “It’s no joke,” said R. Vincent Razor, 68, a writer in Kew Gardens, Queens, who carries two masks in his pockets when he goes out.

"1496","The mask order is statewide and was met differently in some pockets of rural New York.

Do I go into the office lunchroom or not? Do I stop for a drink at this bar, where the stools are six feet apart, or that crowded one my friends chose? Do I use this toilet or that drinking fountain?

"1523","Reporting on the coronavirus has made me think more deeply than I have in years about the nature of risk. In this case, it’s physically microscopic yet as potentially dangerous as risks encountered in conflict zones. Technological and physical barriers have reminded me of the vulnerability reporters share with the people who are our subjects, and reinforced the importance of human connectedness to reporting. It’s easy to discount the value of a facial expression, a tone of voice or a firm handshake in establishing rapport until such things are obscured behind a mask or prohibited by social-distancing rules.","1579715069","6"
"1524","This month I traveled to Holmes County, in central Ohio, to report on how Amish workers, idled by social-distancing guidelines, had pivoted to make face masks, surgical gowns and protective gear for the Cleveland Clinic and other hospitals across the country.

"1525","The next day began at Keim, a lumber and home goods business leading the effort on personal protective equipment. Kelsey Hochstetler, Keim’s communications chief and our guide that day, gave us fluid-resistant, Amish-made masks.

"1557","In many parts of the world, nearly two out of three people wear corrective eyewear. And lately, many of us have the same complaint: Wearing a mask makes our glasses fog.","1583651798","6"
"1558","When we asked readers to send their questions about coronavirus, one of the most commonly asked questions was about how to solve the fogging problem. While the problem is new to us, it’s a daily challenge for health care workers. We asked them for suggestions on how to wear a mask while making sure we’re still able to see through our glasses.","1583651798","6"
"1559","People who wear glasses already know that eyewear fogs when you walk out of a warm house into the cold outdoor air, or when you open an oven door. When we wear a mask, warm breath can escape through the top edges, along the tops of our cheeks. When the hot air lands on cooler lenses, it creates condensation on the surface and a foggy film. Cold weather makes the problem worse.","1583651798","6"
"1560","You can start by improving the seal of the mask around the top of your face.","1583651798","6"
"1561","Mold your mask. Medical masks have built-in, bendable metal strips that you can mold to the bridge of your nose. You can add pipe cleaners to the top of a homemade fabric mask to get the same effect.","1583651798","6"
"1562","Tighten the mask. Adjust the ties or the ear loops so the mask fits snugly against your face. “If the air is going out the top, you don’t have your mask on correctly,” said Shan Soe-Lin, a lecturer at the Yale Jackson Institute for Global Affairs. “Most of the breath should be going through the mask. If you feel the air going in or out around the mask, tighten the ties.”","1583651798","6"
"1563","Tape your mask. Another option is to use white athletic or medical tape or even an adhesive bandage to seal the top of the mask around the bridge of your nose. “This is something a lot of medical students learn early on when they’re using eye protection goggles,” said Dr. Andrew Janowski, instructor of pediatric infectious diseases at Washington University School of Medicine St. Louis Children’s Hospital.","1583651798","6"
"1564","Pull up your mask. An easier tip for day-to-day mask wear is to use the weight of your glasses to block the air. Pull the mask up over the bridge of the nose as high as you can (make sure it’s still under your chin too) and let your glasses rest on top of the mask. I tried this and it works pretty well for me, but it depends on the shape and style of your eyewear.","1583651798","6"
"1565","If you can’t stop the fogging by tightening the seal of your mask, you can try anti-fog home remedies to coat your lenses.","1583651798","6"
"1566","“I haven’t timed it, but the technique reliably works for more than a half-hour when operating,” Dr. Malik said. “Obviously if the face mask is tightly secured on the nose, there is less escape of the moisture toward the glasses and the technique works for longer.”","1583651798","6"
"1567","Skip the swimmer’s remedy. Swimmers and scuba divers have a regular trick to keep glasses from fogging. They spit into their goggles or masks and rub it around. But given that we’re dealing with a respiratory virus and trying to stop the spread of germs, spitting on your glasses is not advised during a pandemic.","1583651798","6"
"1568","At Woodhull, Neena puts on her own armor. She covers her scrubs with a gown that hides her wrists. Her long black hair is tied in a bun.

"1569","When her shift ends, she tapes her N95 mask to the inside of her locker, and wipes down her face shield and stethoscope with alcohol.

"1573","The signature image of Amplifier’s open call, “Global Forefront,” was created by the Los Angeles artist Thomas Wimberly, who works for Mr. Fairey as an art director at Studio Number One, Mr. Fairey’s advertising agency.

"1575","It’s hard to say what was the more unsettling sight: the marquees gone dark, acknowledging that there is no one to see them, or the ones still blazingly lit, illuminating only the garbage blowing past and the occasional masked passer-by. On the side of the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, there was still a video playing over and over, promoting an Off Broadway play called “The Perplexed” that died with the shutdown.","1583830558","6"
"1576","There is beauty, of course; without the crowds, it is easier to see the architectural grandeur.

"1579","And a reopened Broadway could be a changed experience, said Charlotte St. Martin, the president of the Broadway League, a trade organization. “We could see masks. We could see certificates of Covid-19-free status,” Ms. St. Martin said. “We could see fewer shows.”","1583871578","6"

"1584","The social nature of dining out could increase the risk. The longer people linger in a contaminated area, the more virus particles they would likely inhale. Eating is also one activity that cannot be accomplished while wearing a mask. Virus-laden droplets can be expelled into the air through breathing and talking, not just through coughs and sneezes.","1584009814","6"
"1585","The White House’s own current guidelines reflect what most epidemiologists say: Social distancing, limiting personal contact and wearing masks in public are all crucial to keeping the virus in check. Medical experts, including those advising Mr. Trump, have warned that easing these guidelines could lead to a surge in new infections.","1584023003","6"
"1586","It is not difficult to understand why Mr. Trump feels the impulse to back the demonstrators. Footage of the recent protests shows a significant presence of Trump paraphernalia and an outpouring of support for him.

Trump all the way,” he said.","1584023003","6"
"1587","For both experts and laypeople, being able to access dependable health advice has never felt more important, or challenging. The World Health Organization has described a “massive ‘infodemic’ — an overabundance of information, some accurate and some not — that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it.” Indeed, in recent weeks, new research has emerged that complicates such basic questions as who should wear face masks and when; what degree of physical separation is safe; and how the virus primarily spreads.","1584382250","6"
"1588","As a practice, science continuously interrogates and refines our understanding. “The answer is never so simple as ‘Masks work or masks don’t.’ It’s going to be ‘Under what conditions do masks have an effect?’ and ‘How much of an effect do they have?’ ” says Brian Nosek, executive director of the Center for Open Science. “The questions that we want answers to are much more complicated than the evidence that we have at any one moment.” The problem is that now we want those answers to be definitive and fast.","1584382250","6"
"1589","Now those same journals tend to be too specialized for general readers to grasp easily, making the concept of “open access,” as far as the public is concerned, “more of an idea than a reality,” Csiszar says. Nevertheless, the current pandemic has certainly increased both the readership of scientific journals and their citations in the press. Before January, the most-read article in Emerging Infectious Diseases, a 2006 study, had 20,000 views. The current most-viewed article, also from 2006, has more than 480,000 views: It gives instructions for making your own “simple respiratory mask” from a T-shirt.","1584382250","6"
"1590","“Health care workers are for sure all shaving,” says Dr. Elliot Wakeam, a thoracic and lung transplant surgeon at the University of Michigan Medical Center. This is because facial hair inhibits how well an N95 mask fits, the standard mask that health care workers are wearing to protect themselves from being infected by Covid-19. In a January 2020 study published in the Journal of Hospital Infection, researchers evaluated the fit of N95 face masks on 195 male health care workers. Not a single worker with a full beard obtained a proper fit, and the more facial hair a health care worker had, the worse the fit was.","1584382186","6"
"1591","Of course, because N95 masks are in such critically short supply, they should mostly be reserved for health care workers. If, for some reason, you are wearing an N95 mask, though, you might as well wear it correctly.","1584382186","6"
"1592","On March 3, the C.D.C. republished a guide to respirator-friendly facial hair on its website. If you want to give it a try, the “soul patch” and the “Zorro” are fine from a medical standpoint. Mutton chops and the John Muir look are non-starters. When it comes to a cloth mask, Dr. Wakeam says facial hair probably isn’t inhibiting its efficacy, since there isn’t an air-tight seal to begin with.","1584382186","6"
"1593","Dr. Narasimhan is clear that, in the list of risky things you can do during a pandemic, if you’re not needing to wear an N95 mask, growing a beard is near the very bottom. Still, she says there’s some indication that people with beards may touch their faces more often, either because they’re subconsciously grooming those beards or because beards can be itchy. If you happen to have the virus on your hands and you touch your nose, mouth or eyes after playing with your lustrous face-locks, “that’s how you contaminate yourself,” she says.","1584382186","6"
"1594","In court papers, nurses described receiving one N95 mask to use for a week and being denied virus testing at their own hospitals.

I don’t know how. But people are very creative.”","1585231605","6"
"1601","LabCorp said that it would first make the tests available to health care workers and emergency workers who may have been exposed to the virus or have symptoms, and that it would be making the self-collection kits available to consumers “in the coming weeks.” The company noted the home tests would cut down on the demand for masks and other protective equipment that is usually needed to collect testing specimens.","1585231605","6"

"1603","Staying at home is something you do as a domestic unit, and it won’t work if one member of every household feels free to come and go as he or she pleases. The additional risks may not be very great if your nonagenarian’s trips involve proper distancing, proper hand-washing, wearing a cloth mask (which, among other things, would reduce the chance of his touching his face), choosing an hour when the store is least crowded and so on. But someone who can’t grasp what’s wrong with going out for trivial reasons can’t be trusted to maintain the necessary precautions.","1585577974","6"
"1604","Given that you can’t lock him in or kick him out, you might see what can be done to address his needs. If he agrees not to go to the store himself, you can make a list of the things he wants and agree to go buy them yourself; you can practice the necessary safety measures more reliably than he might. But it may be that he’s just feeling stir crazy. If that’s the issue, perhaps you can arrange to go with him on walks in places where there are few people around (taking note of the C.D.C.’s current recommendations concerning the use of cloth masks in public).

"1615","Experts are increasingly suggesting that masks may need to be worn for at least a year, until a vaccine is developed.

"1616","The coronavirus is a crisis that respects no economic division. Everyone is a potential victim; everyone has been affected. The blue and white surgical masks that are currently the most visible personal protective equipment are democratizing forces, rendering all wearers equal under isolation, signifying our communal experience and our collective fear. Even the homemade masks that have begun to proliferate, while somewhat idiosyncratic, are united in their craftiness.","1585577819","6"
"1617","When masks migrate into the realm of fashion, however, they become something else. As with all accessories (as with shoes, bags and scarves), they become symbols of not just health or social concern, but of identity.","1585577819","6"
"1618","After all, with the lower face covered and, often, eyes shaded by sunglasses, the usual signposts of character are hidden. The mask becomes the first signifier of the individual. And that means it will also become a sign of aspiration, achievement — and inequality.","1585577819","6"
"1619","Masks, as a recent story in WWD posited, could even end up on the red carpet — in the form of a “couture mask.” Christian Siriano, one of the first designers to start making masks when Governor Cuomo asked for help, told the publication he has made “this fully encrusted pearl mask because I just needed a break.”","1585577819","6"
"1620","Maybe even President Trump, who has made something of a big deal out of his own reluctance to wear a mask, would don the accessory if it could be used, as he uses his ties and MAGA hats, to broadcast his own power.

"1623","Luxury brands may not be making masks now (just imagine the backlash), but it’s not too big a leap to believe there will come a time when they join the bandwagon, if simply because there is likely to be demand. Besides, they already have the expertise and capabilities.","1585577819","6"
"1624","In part this is why many brands have adopted a “buy one, give one” model, in which for every mask that is bought, they will give one to a worker on the front line (or in Collina Strada’s case, buy one for a lot of money in order to give five). Or they are donating a portion of each sale to a Covid-19-related charity.","1585577819","6"
"1625","This is also why some include explanations with the designs, couching them in civic-minded terms, like this one from MaskClub: “Founder Trevor George’s 8-month-old son was terrified to see him wear a mask, so he decided to make them with recognizable prints to make it less scary.”","1585577819","6"
"1626","It can seem like a Band-Aid for a guilty conscience. And maybe it is. Yet you can’t argue with the need for masks, or that many of the companies making them are doing so because there is little other option: No one is buying the clothes they make, and to create something — anything — for sale is to create a lifeline for employees and suppliers.","1585577819","6"

After the visit, the Mayo Clinic tweeted that it had “informed @VP of the masking policy prior to his arrival today.” The clinic then deleted the tweet.","1585842560","6"
"1637","Mr. Pence later defended his own behavior. “As vice president of the United States, I’m tested for the coronavirus on a regular basis, and everyone who is around me is tested for the coronavirus,” he told reporters. He said he was following C.D.C. guidelines, which indicate that the mask is good for preventing the spread of the virus by those who have it.","1585842560","6"
"1638","For the most part, top officials — from governors and mayors to Mr. Trump and his team — have chosen not to use masks, at least in public or at televised events, even as they encourage people to wear them. Some political analysts say image-conscious politicians may resist masks, even if they are warranted, for fear that the coverings might make them look pessimistic or nervous.","1585842560","6"
"1639","But leaders inevitably risk looking hypocritical by preaching a message about masks and then forgoing, especially when they are surrounded by aides and others. Health experts say modeling behavior is the right thing for public officials to do.","1585842560","6"
"1640","For leaders who do seek to promote best practices, they face the possibility of appearing alien to Americans who have yet to grow accustomed to wearing masks. Bill de Blasio, the Democratic mayor of New York City, for instance, was mocked for looking like an “Old West bank robber” after covering his face with a bandanna while leaving a news conference this month. And Gov. Ron DeSantis, Republican of Florida, committed a gaffe when he tried to put on an N95 mask in public and left one of the straps dangling from his chin.","1585842560","6"
"1641","Political advisers acknowledged that more might go into the decision to don a mask than the advice of health experts. “Masks, whether worn by superheroes or villains, hide your identity,” said Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. “Not always a good idea when you’re selling yourself.”","1585842560","6"
"1642","The decision of whether to appear in public in a face mask does not seem to break down by political party, or by whether a lawmaker represents one of the hot spots of the outbreak.","1585842560","6"
"1643","For instance, Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, a Republican, has been wearing a mask in public since the C.D.C. put out its recommendation, while Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, a Democrat, has defended his decision not to cover his face during news conferences. Both governors lead states with widespread outbreaks of the coronavirus.","1585842560","6"
"1644","Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Democrat of Michigan, was photographed in a mask on April 14 while she toured an alternative care facility.","1585842560","6"
"1645","Last weekend, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, a Democrat who recently issued an executive order requiring New Yorkers to wear a mask in many public places, was seen leaving his house for a walk with what appeared to be a bandanna tied around his face, the first time the public had seen him cover up.","1585842560","6"
"1646","His rule of thumb, aides said, is to wear a mask or face covering, in public or in private, whenever he is less than six feet from anyone else. That doesn’t include his daily news conference, where reporters and government officials sit far apart from one another.","1585842560","6"
"1647","Mr. DeSantis was slow to shut down his state but quicker to don a mask in public, being photographed wearing one on April 8.","1585842560","6"
"1648","“I’ve been wearing a mask when I go out,” Mr. Pritzker told reporters on April 5, after entering the briefing room with his mouth and nose covered. “I did it this morning when I was out, and I did it when I came here.”","1585842560","6"
"1649","Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey, also a Democrat, said at a news conference this month that he had taken his mask off “because otherwise I’m not sure you’d be able to understand us.”","1585842560","6"
"1650","On Capitol Hill, many senators have not worn masks during their pro forma sessions. But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a Republican, was photographed in a surgical mask outside of the Senate on Monday, removing it to deliver his remarks on the Senate floor. And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday simply pulled a blue patterned scarf over her face as she arrived at and departed her news conference.","1585842560","6"
"1651","At the White House, aides have dismissed the few National Security Council officials who wear masks in the West Wing as “alarmists.” And Mr. Trump appeared to scoff at a reporter who tried to ask a question at a recent news conference while wearing a mask, saying he could “barely” hear his question.","1585842560","6"
"1652","Administration officials also dismissed Mr. Polis’s decision to wear a mask while greeting Mr. Pence as a bit of political theater. (Mr. Polis’s office did not return a phone call on Tuesday.) The vice president, aides said, did not need to wear one because he is tested regularly for the coronavirus — a faulty argument, according to public health experts.","1585842560","6"
"1653","Other experts said that, while preventing asymptomatic transmission is the medical goal of the guidelines on masks, it is not the only reason for public officials to wear them. By wearing masks in public, officials model the behavior they are asking citizens to adopt and can help influence people to take the guidelines seriously.","1585842560","6"
"1654","There is disagreement within the medical community on how effective cloth masks — as opposed to surgical or N95 masks — are in preventing asymptomatic transmission, Dr. Adalja said, but “if you’re part of a team that’s actually advocating people to wear those masks, then I think it becomes odd if you’re not wearing a mask.”","1585842560","6"
"1655","Mr. Trump undercut the mask recommendation even as he announced it on April 3, emphasizing repeatedly that it was voluntary.","1585842560","6"

"1657","In many parts of the world, nearly two out of three people wear corrective eyewear. And lately, many of us have the same complaint: Wearing a mask makes our glasses fog.","1585934304","6"
"1658","When we asked readers to send their questions about coronavirus, one of the most commonly asked questions was about how to solve the fogging problem. While the problem is new to us, it’s a daily challenge for health care workers. We asked them for suggestions on how to wear a mask while making sure we’re still able to see through our glasses.","1585934304","6"
"1659","People who wear glasses already know that eyewear fogs when you walk out of a warm house into the cold outdoor air, or when you open an oven door. When we wear a mask, warm breath can escape through the top edges, along the tops of our cheeks. When the hot air lands on cooler lenses, it creates condensation on the surface and a foggy film. Cold weather makes the problem worse.","1585934304","6"
"1660","You can start by improving the seal of the mask around the top of your face.","1585934304","6"
"1661","Mold your mask. Medical masks have built-in, bendable metal strips that you can mold to the bridge of your nose. You can add pipe cleaners to the top of a homemade fabric mask to get the same effect.","1585934304","6"
"1662","Tighten the mask. Adjust the ties or the ear loops so the mask fits snugly against your face. “If the air is going out the top, you don’t have your mask on correctly,” said Shan Soe-Lin, a lecturer at the Yale Jackson Institute for Global Affairs. “Most of the breath should be going through the mask. If you feel the air going in or out around the mask, tighten the ties.”","1585934304","6"
"1663","Tape your mask. Another option is to use white athletic or medical tape or even an adhesive bandage to seal the top of the mask around the bridge of your nose. “This is something a lot of medical students learn early on when they’re using eye protection goggles,” said Dr. Andrew Janowski, instructor of pediatric infectious diseases at Washington University School of Medicine St. Louis Children’s Hospital.","1585934304","6"
"1664","Pull up your mask. An easier tip for day-to-day mask wear is to use the weight of your glasses to block the air. Pull the mask up over the bridge of the nose as high as you can (make sure it’s still under your chin too) and let your glasses rest on top of the mask. I tried this and it works pretty well for me, but it depends on the shape and style of your eyewear.","1585934304","6"
"1665","If you can’t stop the fogging by tightening the seal of your mask, you can try anti-fog home remedies to coat your lenses.","1585934304","6"
"1666","“I haven’t timed it, but the technique reliably works for more than a half-hour when operating,” Dr. Malik said. “Obviously if the face mask is tightly secured on the nose, there is less escape of the moisture toward the glasses and the technique works for longer.”","1585934304","6"
"1667","Skip the swimmer’s remedy. Swimmers and scuba divers have a regular trick to keep glasses from fogging. They spit into their goggles or masks and rub it around. But given that we’re dealing with a respiratory virus and trying to stop the spread of germs, spitting on your glasses is not advised during a pandemic.","1585934304","6"
"1668","To give you a flavor of what’s unfolding to help orchestrate these events, this week one of Mr. Meckler’s organizers told supporters via Facebook that “optics are everything” and that they should be sure to wear a mask to the protests and stand six feet apart — because it will make the crowds look bigger.","1586047718","6"
"1669","Will Toledo, the founder and principal songwriter of Car Seat Headrest, sat in his Seattle apartment, looking into his iPhone camera through the eyes of a modified gas mask.","1586599219","6"
"1670","His face wasn’t visible, but somehow he still seemed a little sheepish. Months ago, Toledo made up his mind to wear a costume, including the mask, while promoting his indie-rock band’s first album of new material since 2016, an atypically concise and beat-driven collection of songs called “Making a Door Less Open.”","1586599219","6"
"1671","He had not thought of the possibility that a global pandemic would turn protective masks into both a commonplace sight and a potent symbol of all-pervasive, amorphous dread.","1586599219","6"
"1672","The mask’s Darth Vaderish quality is relieved by a pair of bright and somewhat googly LED eyes custom-installed by a prop-fabrication studio in Los Angeles, and two floppy ears sewn by a friend of Toledo’s. By request, Toledo wore it for the first half of the interview, which was conducted via FaceTime. But he acknowledged that sticking with this particular conceptual stunt felt a little awkward, given the state of things.","1586599219","6"
"1673","He’d thought of “Making a Door Less Open” as a “daily-life album” whose songs the mask would recontextualize; instead it’s the daily-life aspect of the lyrics that now seems strange. The half-rapped “Hollywood,” a dyspeptic interior monologue about riding the bus and staring at posters for bad movies, plays like a snapshot from a now-bygone age of social proximity. The fever metaphors in the single “Can’t Cool Me Down” might have played better, Toledo observed, “outside the context of constantly thinking about sickness.”","1586599219","6"
"1674","She noted that Toledo is shy but also can come across as fearless — a dichotomy well captured by the mask. “The same can be said about the content of his songs,” she said. “He’s talking about having fears and insecurities and making mistakes, but also he’s willing to admit them, so that’s fearless too.”","1586599219","6"
"1675","Lombardi admitted that the idea of the mask was initially a cause for concern at the label, but added: “The artists’ ideas are always the best ones. Sometimes, as wild as they are, you have to have faith that they’re seeing something you can’t.”","1586599219","6"
"1676","For what it’s worth, after excusing himself from his FaceTime interview to take a bathroom break, Toledo returned without the mask on and finished the conversation as an average-looking guy with a narrow face, shaggy dark hair and a toothy smile.","1586599219","6"
"1677","Asked if wearing the mask in media appearances was about creating a harder line between himself and the version of Toledo who appears in Car Seat Headrest’s songs, he replied: “That might be a part of it. But I think it’s an attempt to get people to look at me in a different way, especially onstage.”","1586599219","6"
"1678","“I’m not trying to take anything away from people,” he continued. “It’s a connection with the music — I don’t want to slam their fingers in the door, regardless of how they have that connection. But I do want to offer something new, and I think the mask is a way to do that.”","1586599219","6"
"1679","“We live on the top floor of a fifth-floor walk up,” Ms. Shy said. “The delivery guy, who wears a mask, comes to the door, sets the bottle on the counter, which is right by our kitchen sink, and leaves,” she continued. “We then put the bottle in the sink and disinfect it. There’s no touching anyone, no slip of paper we need to sign. It’s super easy.”","1586599210","6"
"1680","The knowledge that the whole of humanity, from Thailand to New York, shares our anxieties about how and where to use a face mask, the safest way to deal with the food we have bought from the grocer and whether to self-quarantine is a constant reminder that we are not alone. It begets a sense of solidarity. We are no longer mortified by our fear; we discover a humility in it that encourages mutual understanding.","1586599206","6"
"1681","When Billy Chan flew home to Hong Kong from London in mid-March, he wore a disposable protective suit, goggles and an N95 mask. He changed his mask twice during the 13-hour flight, using hand sanitizer each time.","1586758628","6"
"1682","“I didn’t see anyone go on or off the plane without a mask,” said Mr. Chan, who needed to return to Hong Kong to renew his visa to Britain. Most passengers, he reported, wore goggles or sunglasses as well.","1586758628","6"

"1688","Brian Campbell, who visited his parents’ house in Oklahoma from California in mid-March, said he wore a mask for the entire journey, starting from his ride to the airport, to avoid bringing the virus with him. His taxi driver in Oklahoma commented on the mask and questioned whether it was necessary.","1586758628","6"
"1689","“We don’t have a culture of wearing a mask around,” Mr. Campbell said. “Hopefully, now we’ll move more in that direction.”","1586758628","6"
"1690","But in another sense, I am not OK. My mind has taken photographs of the horror wrought by Covid-19 and they replay at random. I wake up from haunting dreams of being smothered by my N95 mask and face shield. I get through the day by holding reality at a distance. When I allow it to penetrate my mind on my walk home from work, I often cry. I am moving in slow motion through a trauma that has no end or escape in sight.","1586903575","6"
"1691","“I’m not going to gather in crowds,” said Mr. Johnson, who said he is donning a mask when he goes grocery shopping near his home in Oshkosh. “I have enough fear and respect of this illness that I’m not going to do that myself. I’m not encouraging anybody to do it.”","1587016563","6"
"1692","Still, few people wore masks or other protective equipment at the weekend rallies.

"1693","One thing is certain: It’s a term I have been hearing a lot lately from tech types. That’s no surprise, since they tend to go into version-speak as shorthand for everything and anything that is not working and needs the benefit of a “pivot,” another word that’s a Silicon Valley favorite. “Pivot” is a euphemism used to mask the real meaning of what is happening, which is usually a product failure or start-up disaster that requires a turnaround disguised as a triumph.","1587160366","6"

"1702","I believe this image represents the hard work doctors and nurses are pursuing in result to this pandemic. Hospital workers risk their lives every day to care for patients who have the coronavirus. In the image, the nurses and doctors are also wearing masks. This is significant because hospital workers wear masks and gloves in attempt to not get the virus. I have seen many social media posts of nurses and doctors who have bruises on their faces due to the stress of the mask. This contributes to the meaning of the image because it shows the harsh circumstances they are in, and how hard they are working to try and overcome the virus. It’s important for us to acknowledge hospital workers.","1587199932","6"
"1703","Facilities were late to require workers and residents to wear masks — and some were still not enforcing such policies, workers and family members said.

"1708","I work at a hospital in Fairfield County. People I see ignoring the guidelines on the news or in my travels have no idea of how bad the coronavirus is. Sometimes there is very little we can do to save these patients. Even the ones we send home from the E.R. are really sick and can take 2-3 weeks to recover. While the surge is diminishing there are still patients who are really slow to recover. I know everything seems fine wherever you look, but watch some hospital footage and listen to some registered nurse interviews, then decide if you want to skip the mask or congregate together.","1587276837","6"
"1709","My husband and I live in the northern part of the state, near Sandpoint, Idaho. It’s a resort area with a beautiful lake and miles of mountain trails in Forest Service areas.

We are concerned about people traveling from both Washington and Montana for recreation. There are approximately 45,000 people in this county and our hospital has 25 beds with only four I.C.U. rooms. The hospital does not have enough P.P.E. and asked local residents to sew handmade masks.","1587276837","6"

Standing together in a crowd, mask-free and well within the six-foot social-distancing zone, was a physical manifestation of their anger and suspicion.

Selling those masks soon began to look promising.","1587585061","6"
"1737","Donating to the United States could help Harbin make a name in a new market. But to get around the stricter regulations, Mr. Yin had to divide Harbin’s masks into 30 separate boxes addressed to his friends in the United States.

The donor originally wanted to send 40,000 KN95 masks — China’s version of the N95 mask used by front-line medical workers — but at the time the standard was not compliant with U.S. regulations. So Mr. Zhang could buy only 10,000 N95 masks with the money he had for the donation.","1587585061","6"

"1744","SODA AND A CHAUFFEUR I wake at 6:45, have some egg whites and toast. I don’t have coffee; instead I drink a Diet Coke. I know that’s bad, but it’s the bee’s knees. Usually I take the subway, but Dan wakes up and drives me to work now. Even though we’re both wearing masks, we kiss goodbye and say to each other, “I love you.” I walk into the hospital at 7:45 and surprisingly feel relieved. I’m seeing my co-workers and having human engagement, which is comforting.","1587662265","6"
"1745","WATER BINGE At 3:30 I eat again. When we’re wearing layers of masks it’s hard to take a drink of water, so I usually wait and drink two or three bottles at once.

People are in the park, but nowhere near what it should be so it’s a little eerie.","1587662265","6"
"1746","EXIT By 8 I’m disgusting and sweaty. I’ll bleach my shoes and badge and wash down the face shield. I take off the other two surgical masks. I throw away the gown and shower cap. I used to come out of the hospital, and on the street you saw life being lived, and normal things going on. Now you come out and there’s nothing. I can’t see my friends or family or go to dinner with people and talk about the 12 hours I’ve just had with co-workers.","1587662265","6"

At our front door Dan has plastic shopping bags ready. I get naked in my hallway. The clothes go in the bag. The shoes stay in the hallway. They’re not allowed inside. I take a piping hot shower while he Clorox wipes the doorknobs, my keys, wallet, and phone.","1587662265","6"
"1748","Making a point to “enjoy family time” did not always work out. I was constantly shooing my daughters out of the room during work calls. We tried making DIY face masks when that became a thing. The kids soon lost interest and our output of one mask per day was not going to make a dent in the need. Our thermometer was now a permanent fixture on the bathroom counter. My husband and I jumped at any hint of a cough and anxiously checked the kids’ temps every day. No one was feverish, but a feeling of helplessness had set in.","1587678685","6"
"1749","Looking back on this image, it feels surreal. We can’t even imagine being that close together or holding the subway pole with our bare hands.

They are — of course they are — making a slew of Covid-related start-up investments. And a coolheaded blog called The Prepared, with features like “Prepping Checklist for Beginners” and “Rational Reasons You Should Prepare,” is emerging as the voice of a movement.","1587837068","6"
"1751","Sam Altman, the head of OpenAI, a group studying artificial intelligence, became a figurehead of the Bay Area prepper movement after a 2016 New Yorker article appeared in which he acknowledged amassing “guns, gold, potassium iodide, antibiotics, batteries, water, gas masks from the Israeli Defense Force, and a big patch of land in Big Sur I can fly to.”","1587837068","6"
"1752","He’s not in Big Sur today — not yet, at least. When I called him recently, he was still in San Francisco, where he has been working with his brother, Max Altman, to organize a bulk order of one billion single-use masks from China.","1587837068","6"
"1753","On Feb. 13, when Vox published an article headlined “‘No handshakes, please’: The tech industry is terrified of the coronavirus,” many tech preppers became incensed, convinced they were being mocked — and that the public was not listening. Much of the mainstream news coverage at the time relied on the World Health Organization and government messaging that discouraged mask-wearing and downplayed the virus’s risks.","1587837068","6"
"1754","But in January, when I started to notice preppers in an especially high-pitched tizzy about some kind of pneumonia in China, I bought some Lysol. Then some gloves, a couple masks. I found The Prepared and devoured its advice. The site’s central argument made sense: that preparing myself meant I would take up one less spot in the health care system in a crisis. I started to think about what I take for granted. It was kind of a game to play at night, trying to imagine how different parts of my world might falter and how I would stay alive.","1587837068","6"
"1755","Soon I had a prepper box. Inside was flu medicine, headlamps, sardines, gloves, goggles, duct tape, a tarp, a Vipertek VTS-989 stun gun, some whistles. Because of it, I’ve been able to mail supplies to my parents, and I’ve been able to give precious hand sanitizer and high-quality masks to friends. I ended up over-prepping, so I donated the extra to a local clinic.","1587837068","6"
"1756","“I texted my colleagues and said, ‘I think it’s time to go in,’” she said. Once admitted, she was placed on oxygen with a mask.

"1757","We were alone at home. I felt that sitting at home I was useless, so I started to go on a crusade to find personal protective equipment for people at the hospital. It became a hustling game. I put something on social media and see if people would do good for us. I received a reply, about an exterminator who might have some protective equipment, and I followed the lead and he said, “I don’t have N95 masks, but I have hazmat suits.” And I said, “Send me those.” And then he knew another guy who had a couple of boxes of N95s, and I had them shipped to the hospital, care of the executive director.","1588032963","6"
"1758","I was also scared that I was going to have to go to the hospital — and I didn’t want to go to the hospital. I knew what was going on at the hospital. I understood how lonely this disease can get. If somebody with Covid is sick enough to be dropped off at the hospital, the terror of that has to be the most isolating and lonely experience in the world, going to a hospital where you will not have visitors and where people caring for you — giving you the care that will save your life — will be scared, too, and covered in protective clothing and face shields and masks.","1588032963","6"
"1759","After the wrestlers texted me, I would get up and go walk in the yard. I walked as fast as I could, which was pretty slow, and I tried to take a breath and hold it 10 seconds and maybe expand my lungs. No matter how bad I felt the whole time, I made sure I got out of bed, I put on a mask, and I went out into my yard. I walked around the yard five times. I did not let my lungs get stagnant. By that point I had figured out other strategies too. For example, if you are going to lie down, you have to lie in a prone position, on your chest. It makes it easier to breathe.","1588032963","6"
"1760","It was bad enough that the next day I went to an urgent-care clinic to see what was happening. My wife drove me in a mask and gloves. I tried two urgent-care places. They wouldn’t let me in. They want you to stay outside and tell them what is going on. I told them I was a doctor and had been dealing with Covid for more than two weeks. I told them I wanted to get a chest X-ray and that I have a cardiologist and a pulmonologist — I needed an X-ray. They flat-out refused.","1588032963","6"

"1893","It’s too easy to imagine antibody tests becoming a new form of discrimination: Employers might insist on antibody certificates simply to minimize absenteeism or medical costs among their workers; employees might find it easier to work with colleagues who have antibody certificates rather than to continue with face masks and social distancing. Workers in grocery stores and other essential services have already taken risks by working throughout the crisis; imagine if they lost their jobs for want of an antibody certificate.","1590969790","6"
"1894","It would be one thing for an antibody certificate to, say, exempt a person from the need to wear a mask, but quite another to allow employers to insist on a certificate as a cheaper alternative to testing, enforced social distancing and other preventive measures.

"1896","A longer list circulated two weeks ago by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce includes some things the administration could do on its own — like Labor Department guidance about mask requirements and the steps it will deem sufficient to meet Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards. Others include steps only Congress could enact, like passing a law taking away people’s right to file lawsuits in state courts over allegations that a business was negligent in taking pandemic precautions. A range of legal specialists in civil lawsuits over claimed injuries and labor law said the business lobby’s requests include both sensible ideas that could be put in place quickly and politically implausible stretches. The risk, they said, is that if the lobby asks for too much, it could get bogged down, forestalling the changes needed for the eventual recovery.","1591290361","6"
"1897","For example, he said, it would be useful to promulgate guidance that, if a business requires its workers and customers to wear masks and practice social distancing to the extent practicable, it would have a “safe harbor” from being considered by the federal government to be negligent — a standard that could also discourage state-court lawsuits. He also said it made sense to tell businesses they could require employees to pass a test for the virus before returning to work without running afoul of disability discrimination and health privacy laws.","1591290361","6"
"1898","But the chamber’s list, he says, goes far beyond that, ranging from tiny issues — like wanting to relieve employers from a need to provide masks or train employers in how to properly use them — to gutting hard-fought labor laws in ways that seem unjustified, like permitting employers to bar older workers from returning to work based on fears that they may be statistically more vulnerable to serious symptoms.","1591290361","6"

The hospital ran through a series of questions to assess the daughters’ own exposure to the coronavirus, and then administrators allowed Bethaney, 24; Le’Treion, 32; and Nicole to come to his room. Wearing gowns, gloves and masks, they prayed over his body and said goodbye. At 1:30, when Charles took his last breath, Nicole, his wife of nearly 30 years, was by his side. “I told God, ‘I love him; I’m leaving him in your hands,.” she says. “I said, ‘Please let him rest, let him go in peace.'”","1592021614","6"

"2056","The decision not to wear a mask has, for some, become a rebellion against what they regard as an incursion on their personal liberties. For many others, the choice is a casual one more about convenience than politics. The choice can also be a reflection of vanity, or of not understanding when or where to wear one.

Trump’s three and a half years in the White House have made us nostalgic for normality, for politics with at least a baseline of decency, diligence and decorum.

"2173","Overnight, masks have become a symbol of social responsibility. If you still need convincing, here’s why you now should be wearing a mask in public spaces to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.","1597911264","6"
"2174","An estimated 25 percent of people with coronavirus feel perfectly fine and don’t know they are infected and could be contagious. And guess what? You could very well be one of them! That’s why you should wear a mask to protect other people from your stealth germs.","1597911264","6"
"2175","Even a simple mask is very effective at trapping droplets from your coughs and sneezes. A recent study published in Nature from the University of Hong Kong and the University of Maryland asked 111 people, infected with various viral illnesses (influenza, rhinovirus and a more-mild coronavirus), to exhale into a giant funnel. Sometimes their noses and mouths weren’t covered; other times they used a simple, not-particularly-well-fitted mask.","1597911264","6"
"2176","Without the masks, the infected people exhaled contagious droplets and aerosols, tiny particles that linger in the air, about 30 percent of the time they were tested. When the infected patients wore a mask, it blocked nearly 100 percent of viral droplets and some of the aerosol particles.","1597911264","6"
"2177","“If we look at all the results together, we found that masks were able to stop most virus-laden respiratory droplets and some of the virus-laden aerosols,” said Ben Cowling, at the School of Public Health of the University of Hong Kong, and the study’s senior author.","1597911264","6"
"2178","While we know that even a simple mask does a pretty good job of protecting the world from your outgoing germs, experts say there is more variation in how much homemade masks might protect you from incoming germs, depending on the fit and quality of the material used.","1597911264","6"
"2179","But the thing is, you don’t need a super-efficient mask if you’re practicing social distancing and washing your hands. And if you use a fabric with decent filtration potential — like two layers of heavy cotton or flannel — and you wear the mask properly, you increase your chances of avoiding the virus.","1597911264","6"
"2180","The bottom line is that when you practice social distancing, wash your hands and wear a mask during those times when you must leave the house, you are lowering your risk for getting sick.","1597911264","6"
"2181","In parts of Asia, where communities have dealt with serious contagions like SARS and MERS, wearing a mask isn’t considered weird. In fact, it’s expected. The more everyone wears a mask, the more accepted mask wearing will become.","1597911264","6"
"2182","“If everybody has to wear a mask, there’s no stigma,” said Shan Soe-Lin, a lecturer at the Yale Jackson Institute for Global Affairs. “I would like to see it change social norms. In Hong Kong, it’s a good thing to see someone in a mask. If you’re sick, you put a mask on. You’re kind of rude to be coughing without a mask on.","1597911264","6"
"2183","Always wash your hands first. Don’t touch the fabric part of the mask — that’s essentially the germ filter, and you don’t want to spread whatever germs it has trapped. Use the ear loops or ties to secure your mask and to remove it. The coverage area should go from near the bridge of your nose to down under your chin and stretch about halfway or more toward your ears. Pull the ties and loops so that it fits as snugly as possible against your face. If your mask has pleats, the folded side should be down.","1597911264","6"
"2184","The writer Peter Hessler, who recently wrote about life in lockdown in China for The New Yorker, created names for the various ways in which people take breaks from masks while wearing them as a way to explain the right and wrong ways to wear a mask to his daughters. The “holster” is a mask pulled down and resting on the neck. The “flap jack” happens when a person takes one ear loop off to talk on the phone. And then there’s the “low rider.” “This is when you pretend that you are obeying the rules, but actually tug the mask down so that your nostrils are uncovered,” he said. All can make the mask far less effective in protecting against germs.","1597911264","6"
"2185","In theory, fidgeting with a mask could introduce germs to your face, but if you’re touching your face that much, you are greatly increasing the risk of getting sick anyway.","1597911264","6"
"2186","But the real worry about wearing a mask is that you start to believe it’s protecting you more than it really is. Behavioral economists know that when people begin to feel safe, they take more risks. It’s a phenomenon seen when federal regulations first made cars safer with added features like seatbelts, and people responded by driving more recklessly. When doctors wear decontamination gowns, studies show they may become more lax about safety protocols. When communities in Mexico began outdoor mosquito spraying to combat dengue fever, families were less likely to adopt personal prevention practices.","1597911264","6"
"2187","Masks do make us feel safer, but any benefit of wearing a mask will be quickly negated if we lose our resolve about social distancing and hand washing.

"2188","The recommendation is to wear a mask at all times in public spaces because we don’t know who has the virus and who doesn’t. It’s also more socially responsible to wear a mask, even if you’re outside.","1597911264","6"

"2195","N95 respirator masks: These masks fit tightly to the face and have the highest filtration efficiency, blocking 95 percent of particles of 0.3 microns or larger. An N95 mask protects medical workers who come into contact with high doses of the virus while visiting and carrying out medical procedures on multiple patients. The rest of us don’t need that level of protection, so these masks should be reserved for health care workers only. To learn more about how these masks work, check out this video animation from the Arizona State University Risk Innovation Lab.","1597911264","6"
"2196","Medical masks: These are also in short supply and should be used only by medical workers. Sometimes called surgical masks or procedure masks, these masks are those rectangular shaped coverings (often pleated) that come with elastic ear loops. Medical masks are made of a paper-like nonwoven material, and are often given to a coughing patient waiting to see a doctor. Compared to the N95 mask, a medical mask filters about 60 to 80 percent of particles and, according to the Food and Drug Administration, mostly blocks “large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays or splatter that may contain germs.”","1597911264","6"
"2197","Homemade fabric masks: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends we cover our faces with a scarf or homemade fabric mask when we are in public. The effectiveness of homemade masks varies depending on the fabric used, the style and the fit.","1597911264","6"
"2198","In laboratory tests, some homemade masks did a poor job, while others rivaled the filtration of a medical mask. In another study, 21 people made their own masks out of T-shirts, and researchers compared the homemade masks to medical masks. “Both masks significantly reduced the number of microorganisms expelled by volunteers,” although surgical masks were better, wrote the study authors. In community studies, homemade masks were found to offer some protection during viral outbreaks.","1597911264","6"

"2200","Remember, any face covering is better than no face covering. While some people are experimenting with homemade masks using air filters and vacuum bags, the average person doesn’t need that level of protection if you’re practicing social distancing and leaving the house only for essentials. Given that there is so much variability in fabrics, the best advice is to start with a light test. Hold the fabric or mask up to the light and see how much light gets through. The tighter the weave, the less light you’ll see, and the more protection you’ll get. Test the fabric over your face to make sure you can still breathe through it, though.","1597911264","6"
"2201","Because of a shortage of masks, aerosol scientists around the country have been testing everyday materials to see how well they might work in a homemade mask. Most of the time, they have compared the amount and size of particles filtered to the standard used for medical masks — 0.3 microns. However, an often-cited 2013 study from University of Cambridge used a different standard, testing two layers of materials using particles of about 1 micron. Linsey Marr, an aerosol scientist at Virginia Tech, notes that while the 0.3 micron test is a higher standard, the 1 micron test still can be useful in helping people make decisions about mask materials. “There are probably a lot more viruses in 1 micron droplets/aerosols than in 0.3 micron droplets/aerosols,” said Dr. Marr. “So even if a mask only removes 20% of the droplets/aerosols that are 0.3 microns in size, it probably does better with the 1 micron droplet/aerosols,materials testing.”","1597911264","6"

"2203","T-shirts: Most of us have an old T-shirt we could cut up into a no-sew mask. It’s one of the most convenient fabrics to use, but there is a lot of variability in how well T-shirt material performs in lab tests. At the Virginia Tech, a single-layer of an old cotton T-shirt captured 20 percent of particles down to 0.3 microns. It captured 50 percent of particles down to 1 micron. A 2013 University of Cambridge study tested two layers of T-shirt which captured about 70 percent of particles down to 1 micron. ","1597911264","6"
"2204","Cotton quilting fabric: This is the high-thread-count cotton fabric preferred by quilters for its durability. In studies at Wake Forest Baptist Health, masks made with quilting fabric rivaled the filtration efficiency of surgical masks.","1597911264","6"
"2205","Tea towels: Tea towels became a popular source of mask material after an August 2013 study from researchers at University of Cambridge found the material compared well to a medical mask at the 1 micron particle size. The study authors did not note the brand. The towel used was not terry cloth, but the tightly-woven absorbent tea towel variety.","1597911264","6"
"2206","Pillow cases: Pillow cases are a good option for sewers who don’t have other fabric. In the 2013 study, 2 layers of pillow case fabric tested close to the efficiency of a surgical mask at the 1 micron standard, but in a study at Missouri University of Science & Technology, it took four layers of 600-thread-count pillow case material to achieve that level of protection at the 0.3 micron standard.","1597911264","6"
"2207","Flannel pajamas: A two-layer mask of flannel and cotton was one of the best tested in the Wake Forest Baptist study and rivaled the efficiency of a surgical mask","1597911264","6"
"2208","Coffee filters and paper towels: The C.D.C. suggests inserting a coffee filter into your mask for extra protection. Missouri University of Science & Technology scientists found that using three coffee filters made it difficult to breathe. Adding a layer of paper towel in between two layers of fabric could make your homemade mask more efficient. An engineer at an air purifier firm ran his own test and found a single paper towel filters 23 percent of 0.3 microns and two paper towels filtered 33 percent. We added a paper towel to our homemade T-shirt mask.","1597911264","6"
"2209","Filters and vacuum bags: Scientists trying to find effective alternatives for medical workers have cut up layers of air filters and tested HEPA vacuum bags. Both can work quite well, but both have significant downsides. Air filters, when cut up, can release fibers that can be dangerous to inhale, so the filter material should be sandwiched between layers of heavy cotton fabric if used in a mask. Vacuum bags are good filters but not that breathable. Plus, some brands of vacuum bags may contain fiberglass so should not be used to cover your face.","1597911264","6"

"2213","Medical masks and N95 masks should be saved for medical workers, but if you have a medical mask, you should know that it was designed for one-time use. However a number of scientists, led by a group at Stanford University, are studying the best way to sanitize masks to extend the life of the personal protective equipment used by medical workers during the current shortage.","1597911264","6"
"2214","The problem is that washing or sanitizing a medical mask will degrade it, making it less effective. Scientists have found that using UV light, heat and humidity or a hydrogen peroxide vapor could work, but the methods are developed for use in hospitals with special equipment and are not for home use. You can learn more in our story about efforts to decontaminate thousands of medical masks. ","1597911264","6"
"2215","“I would be wary of putting them in the oven because of the potential to reach too high a temperature and melt the plastic fibers, thus damaging the mask,” said Linsey Marr, a leading aerosol scientist at Virginia Tech who has been studying ways to extend the life of medical masks. “Studies on other viruses show inactivation at about 150 degrees Fahrenheit, which is lower than many ovens can go. But that’s with high humidity, and the humidity makes a big difference. If you have an oven that can hit 150 degrees and you put a pan of water in there, this could be effective, but nobody has tested the method on this specific virus.”","1597911264","6"
"2216","If you have multiple masks, the best strategy is to rotate use of the masks over several days, which gives time for the virus to die. For medical workers, one strategy is to keep a set of five masks, so they can wear a new mask every day and return to the first mask on the sixth day.","1597911264","6"
"2217","“The safest thing to do might be to put the mask somewhere safely out of reach,” said Dr. Marr. “Over a few days, the viruses should decay. In fact, studies have found that viruses usually decay faster on fabric and other porous materials than on hard materials like steel or plastic.”","1597911264","6"
"2218","It’s much easier to clean a fabric mask than a medical mask. The C.D.C. says fabric masks should be “washed routinely.” The mask experts I spoke with wash theirs daily in a machine or a sink, just using regular laundry soap. You can use the dryer or let it air dry. Although it’s not necessary, you can also go over it with a hot iron for a full assault on any germs that might remain.","1597911264","6"
"2219","Just as with a medical mask, chemicals like bleach or hydrogen peroxide will begin to degrade the fabric fibers, making the mask less effective. Dr. Marr notes that a virus can’t replicate outside the body, and if virus particles have been trapped by the mask, they are pretty well stuck there and will decay or be removed during washing.","1597911264","6"
"2220","“Washing with soap and water should work,” Dr. Marr said. “I throw my cloth mask in the washing machine with the rest of the laundry and dry it on low heat.

"2248","A longer list circulated two weeks ago by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce includes some things the administration could do on its own — like Labor Department guidance about mask requirements and the steps it will deem sufficient to meet Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards. Others include steps only Congress could enact, like passing a law taking away people’s right to file lawsuits in state courts over allegations that a business was negligent in taking pandemic precautions. A range of legal specialists in civil lawsuits over claimed injuries and labor law said the business lobby’s requests include both sensible ideas that could be put in place quickly and politically implausible stretches. The risk, they said, is that if the lobby asks for too much, it could get bogged down, forestalling the changes needed for the eventual recovery.","1597996570","6"
"2249","For example, he said, it would be useful to promulgate guidance that, if a business requires its workers and customers to wear masks and practice social distancing to the extent practicable, it would have a “safe harbor” from being considered by the federal government to be negligent — a standard that could also discourage state-court lawsuits. He also said it made sense to tell businesses they could require employees to pass a test for the virus before returning to work without running afoul of disability discrimination and health privacy laws.","1597996570","6"
"2250","But the chamber’s list, he says, goes far beyond that, ranging from tiny issues — like wanting to relieve employers from a need to provide masks or train employers in how to properly use them — to gutting hard-fought labor laws in ways that seem unjustified, like permitting employers to bar older workers from returning to work based on fears that they may be statistically more vulnerable to serious symptoms.","1597996570","6"

"2298","Callen-Lorde continued monitoring patients through telemedicine, often laboriously chasing them down by phone and email. The center kept a close eye on its dwindling supplies of gloves, masks, gowns and hand sanitizer. Some staff members started to get sick; Fortenberry set up a team to monitor them in quarantine and decide when it was safe to return.","1598245693","6"
"2299","Minutes after he learned the address of the new quarantine hotel, Fortenberry called an Uber, threw whatever supplies and equipment he could into the trunk and rode to Queens. By the end of the day, his staff had filled the hotel’s basement gym with masks, gloves and gowns. They scoured nearby bodegas for more acetaminophen and ibuprofen. The staff turned the breakfast area into a triage space, with a row of tables serving as a makeshift barrier. Fortenberry had ordered a printer, scanner and filing cabinet for basic record-keeping, but these had not arrived yet. Handwritten files on the hotel’s first two dozen occupants piled up on a conference table in the business center.","1598245693","6"
"2300","In one of our first conversations, Fortenberry told me he planned on spending a day or two at the hotel, setting things up, until the regular staff settled into a rhythm. Two weeks later, he found himself still showing up most days at 8 in the morning and staying until 8:30 or 9 at night. Working behind a mask and goggles, he did what he could to form bonds, quickly and at scale, with individual patients. Sometimes he’d tell his Covid-19 patients that he was smiling behind his mask, though that may already have been clear from his large, almond-shaped eyes.","1598245693","6"
"2301","The rooms at the hotel lacked IVs, heart monitors, oxygen masks and resuscitation equipment. By the second week of April, the site held about 150 patients. With five to seven medical staff at any given moment, that meant that medical check-ins took place around four times per day. But “if you’re sitting in a hotel room and having trouble breathing, I don’t want you to not call me,” Fortenberry said. “Someone who is otherwise healthy can take a turn for the worse really quickly. So it’s important that you feel comfortable calling. I want you to err on the side of caution.” That day he had met a woman in her early 20s, most likely pregnant, who was living in a women’s shelter because of a violent partner. She had asthma, a high fever and pneumonia, and was awaiting the results of a Covid-19 test. Fortenberry delivered all of her meals personally and asked about her favorite foods. “It’s hard because you can’t hold someone’s hand,” he said. “You’re all gloved up.” He said that he had sympathy for those who chose to walk out of the hotel. “People get stir-crazy,” he said. “Anyone would. Imagine you’re sick and you get stuck in a hotel room and you’re not allowed to leave for an entire week. You can only watch so much TV.”","1598245693","6"
"2302","Back at home, he stayed up attending Zoom meetings and catching up on email. There was just too much to be done. On the second or third day, the hotel’s staff engineer walked off the job, along with most of the cleaning staff. They took access to room keys and cleaning supplies along with them. The city was able to find replacements within 24 hours, but there were still only enough hands to clean rooms during changes between patients. During a patient’s stay, the job of changing sheets, cleaning toilets and providing for daily necessities like soap and toothpaste fell to the doctors and nurses on Fortenberry’s staff. The staff’s medical gowns and N95 masks were worn until they became visibly soiled. The risks to their own health were significant, which was part of why Fortenberry stayed. “I don’t want to ask them to do anything that I wouldn’t do myself,” he told me one evening during the third week of April. “Morale has been harder to maintain the longer we have to keep this up. The adrenaline has worn off.”","1598245693","6"

Kilmer believed that even if he and his team couldn’t take an airplane, they could just drive to Austin and still screen “Mark Twain Dreams of the Resurrection” and, I don’t know, will the festival into existence. He was undaunted by all the signs and portents that made it feel as if the world were dropping to its knees; he believed if he could get the film done and over to Austin, the rest would take care of itself. So when he asked me if South by Southwest would be canceled, I told him I didn’t know. The surgeon general had started asking the public not to hoard surgical masks, and just that morning, Los Angeles had declared a state of emergency.","1598245690","6"

They wanted to see Batman, so Kilmer stuck around in the suit, but they didn’t want to talk to him. They wanted to try on the mask and ride in the Batmobile. He understood then that Batman isn’t meant to be a real guy. Batman is meant to be so anonymous that the person who is looking at him can see himself in him. “That’s why it’s so easy to have five or six Batmans,” he says now. “It’s not about Batman. There is no Batman.” And so what kind of thing is that to play, a person whose job is to be as nonspecific as possible. He looked good in the Batsuit, but wearing it was torture. When he took it off, he was finally free.","1598245690","6"

"2330","While a simple face covering can reduce the spread of coronavirus by blocking outgoing germs from coughs or sneezes of an infected person, experts say there is more variation in how much homemade masks might protect the wearer from incoming germs, depending on the fit and quality of the material used.","1598884898","6"
"2331","If you don’t have any of the materials that were tested, a simple light test can help you decide whether a fabric is a good candidate for a mask.","1598884898","6"
"2332","“Hold it up to a bright light,” said Dr. Scott Segal, chairman of anesthesiology at Wake Forest Baptist Health who recently studied homemade masks. “If light passes really easily through the fibers and you can almost see the fibers, it’s not a good fabric. If it’s a denser weave of thicker material and light doesn’t pass through it as much, that’s the material you want to use.”","1598884898","6"
"2333","Researchers say it’s important to remember that lab studies are conducted under perfect conditions with no leaks or gaps in the mask, but the test methods give us a way to compare materials. And while the degree of filtration for some homemade masks seems low, most of us — who are staying home and practicing social distancing in public — don’t need the high level of protection required for medical workers. More important, any face covering is better than none, especially if worn by a person who has the virus but doesn’t know it.","1598884898","6"
"2334","The biggest challenge of choosing a homemade mask material is to find a fabric that is dense enough to capture viral particles, but breathable enough that we can actually wear it. Some items being touted online promise high filtration scores, but the material would be unwearable.","1598884898","6"
"2335","To test everyday materials, scientists are using methods similar to those used to test medical masks, which everybody agrees should be saved for medical workers who are exposed to high doses of virus from seeing infected patients. The best medical mask — called the N95 respirator — filters out at least 95 percent of particles as small as 0.3 microns. By comparison, a typical surgical mask — made using a rectangular piece of pleated fabric with elastic ear loops — has a filtration efficiency ranging from 60 to 80 percent.","1598884898","6"
"2336","The problem with air filters is that they potentially could shed small fibers that would be risky to inhale. So if you want to use a filter, you need to sandwich the filter between two layers of cotton fabric. Dr. Wang said one of his grad students made his own mask by following the instructions in the C.D.C. video, but adding several layers of filter material inside a bandanna.","1598884898","6"
"2337","If you are lucky enough to know a quilter, ask them to make you a mask. Tests performed at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C., showed good results for homemade masks using quilting fabric. Dr. Segal, of Wake Forest Baptist Health, who led the study, noted that quilters tend to use high-quality, high-thread count cotton. The best homemade masks in his study were as good as surgical masks or slightly better, testing in the range of 70 to 79 percent filtration. Homemade masks that used flimsier fabric tested as low as 1 percent filtration, Dr. Segal said.","1598884898","6"
"2338","The best-performing designs were a mask constructed of two layers of high-quality, heavyweight “quilter’s cotton,” a two-layer mask made with thick batik fabric, and a double-layer mask with an inner layer of flannel and outer layer of cotton.","1598884898","6"
"2339","Bonnie Browning, executive show director for the American Quilter’s Society, said that quilters prefer tightly woven cottons and batik fabrics that stand up over time. Ms. Browning said most sewing machines can handle only two layers of fabric when making a pleated mask, but someone who wanted four layers of protection could wear two masks at a time.","1598884898","6"
"2340","Ms. Browning said she recently reached out to quilters on Facebook and heard from 71 people who have made a combined total of nearly 15,000 masks. “We quilters are very much in the thick of what’s going on with this,” said Ms. Browning, who lives in Paducah, Ky. “One thing most of us have is a stash of fabric.”","1598884898","6"
"2341","People who don’t sew could try a folded origami mask, created by Jiangmei Wu, assistant professor of interior design at Indiana University. Ms. Wu, who is known for her breathtaking folded artwork, said she began designing a folded mask out of a medical and building material called Tyvek, as well as vacuum bags, after her brother in Hong Kong, where mask wearing is common, suggested it. (DuPont, the maker of Tyvek, said in a statement that Tyvek is intended for medical apparel, not masks.) The folded mask pattern is free online, as is a video demonstrating the folding process. In tests at Missouri University and University of Virginia, scientists found that vacuum bags removed between 60 percent and 87 percent of particles. But some brands of vacuum bags may contain fiberglass or are harder to breathe through than other materials, and shouldn’t be used. Ms. Wu used a bag by EnviroCare Technologies, which has said it does not use fiberglass in its paper and synthetic cloth bags.","1598884898","6"
"2342","“I wanted to create an alternative for people who don’t sew,” said Ms. Wu, who said she is talking to various groups to find other materials that will be effective in a folded mask. “Given the shortage of all kinds of materials, even vacuum bags might run out.”","1598884898","6"

"2356","The federal C.D.C., like the World Health Organization, had advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. (The New York Times and other news outlets had been reporting the C.D.C.’s previous guidance.)","1599093520","6"
"2357","The C.D.C. now recommends that everyone wear face coverings in public settings, like pharmacies and grocery stores, to avoid unwittingly spreading the virus. Public health officials have continued to stress, however, that N95 masks and surgical masks should be saved for front-line doctors and nurses, who have been in dire need of protective gear.","1599093520","6"
"2358","Ideally, clinicians would be using a new, tightly-sealed respirator, like the N95, with each patient. These are thicker than standard surgical masks, and are designed to fit more tightly around the mouth and nose to block out much smaller particles. The Food and Drug Administration said that neither surgical masks nor N95s should be shared or be reused.","1599093520","6"
"2359","Now, except in the case of intubations, which involve inserting a breathing tube, the agency says standard surgical masks are acceptable when examining or treating a coronavirus patient. (This aligns more closely with the W.H.O., which advises that surgical masks can be used in some situations, but warns that they are not sufficient on their own.)","1599093520","6"
"2360","Now, the C.D.C. also outlines a crisis strategy for wearing the same mask for repeated encounters with different patients. It suggests medical professionals may need to use masks beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life date, and to prioritize the use of masks for activities in which there may be sprays, splashes or prolonged exposure.","1599093520","6"

It was in March — has it really only been a couple of months? — that I sent him the N95 masks a prescient friend had urged me to buy for myself in January; I was worried that Sam’s hospital wouldn’t have enough.

"2492","As Germany scrambles to find enough face masks to reopen the economy and public life while keeping the coronavirus at bay, a number of serious and not-so-serious businesses have jumped into the fray with masks.","1602759691","6"
"2493","They have tried to produce and sell the bizarre (masks made from bras), the unexpected (the Playmobil mask), the hip (an upcycled cotton mask by a Berlin designer) and the customizable (why not advertise while protecting yourself?).","1602759691","6"
"2494","But as Chancellor Angela Merkel has frequently acknowledged, the crucial problem is ensuring that Germans have a sufficient number of quality masks.","1602759691","6"
"2495","“The pandemic teaches us that it is not good if protective equipment is sourced exclusively from distant countries,” Ms. Merkel told Parliament. “Masks that cost a few cents can become a strategic factor in a pandemic.” The minister of economy, Peter Altmaier, estimated that the country needs up to 12 billion masks a year.","1602759691","6"
"2496","Many masks that filter small particles using microfiber rely on material whose production has mostly moved to Asia. In the mad rush to secure the raw materials, politicians and businesspeople have made it their business to find a source.","1602759691","6"
"2497","“It’s been a long time since the textile materials sector has gotten so much attention,” said Dr. David Schmelzeisen, a textile engineer who runs need-mask.com, which connects suppliers with customers.","1602759691","6"
"2498","The essential ingredient in many medical-grade masks — what separates them from simple home made versions — is a filter made of nonwoven super thin fibers, formed in a process known as melt-blown extrusion. Since the pandemic, demand for so-called melt-blown fiber has skyrocketed.","1602759691","6"
"2499","For Melitta, melt-blown fiber is readily available: It makes its own, mainly for use in vacuum cleaner bags. A truck drives big rolls of it from the vacuum and filter factory in Spenge 30 miles to Minden, where Melitta has been based since its founding in 1908. (Melitta also makes coffee filters in the United States, but not face masks.)","1602759691","6"
"2500","The coffee-filter-shaped masks are produced on the same machine as the filters found in grocery store aisles. Although they physically resemble a normal coffee filter, the masks are made from different material (making them unsuitable for brewing coffee).","1602759691","6"

"2505","This initiative is not the first time Melitta has considered getting into the face mask business. About a decade ago, it looked into manufacturing masks because the process fit with the company’s expertise.","1602759691","6"
"2506","“The idea that the shape of filter bags for breathing masks could serve as a model was absurd to many,” Mr. Korte said. “The production of breathing masks was then still a niche topic for us, and was therefore rejected.”","1602759691","6"

"2512","Four days into a national lockdown to stem the outbreak, the French government spokeswoman, Sibeth Ndiaye, warned that face masks were so unfamiliar that wearing them was too difficult technically and could even be “counterproductive.” Even on Thursday morning, when asked whether she wore a mask or made her children wear one, she said, “Oh, no, not at all.”","1602922518","6"
"2513","The shift for Western nations is profound and has had to overcome not merely the logistical challenges of securing enough masks, which are significant enough, but also a deep cultural resistance and even stigma associated with mask-wearing, which some Western leaders described flatly as “alien.”","1602922518","6"
"2514","Seemingly, it won’t be for much longer. After discouraging people from wearing face masks, France, like the United States, has begun urging its citizens to wear basic or homemade ones outside. And some parts of Europe are moving faster than the United States by requiring masks instead of simply recommending their use.","1602922518","6"

"2523","The difference in mind-set is a crucial one given the nature of all but the highest-grade masks: Masks are believed to have some effectiveness at protecting the wearer, especially in crowded spaces, but are most effective at reducing the risks that the virus will be spread through coughing or talking.","1602922518","6"
"2524","The French government initially said that the vast majority of people need not wear face masks because they didn’t guarantee the wearer protection. In Asia, and in a few European nations, the logic has been fundamentally different: If all individuals wear masks, the society will be protected.","1602922518","6"
"2525","On Monday, Austria made masks mandatory in supermarkets and drugstores, and riders of public transportation will also be required to wear them next week. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said that the change would require a “big adjustment” because “masks are alien to our culture.”","1602922518","6"
"2526","But masks were also alien to Asia until it was struck by the SARS pandemic in 2003.","1602922518","6"
"2527","In Japan, after people got used to masks, they continued to wear them against seasonal allergies or to protect one another from germs. Unlike in other Asian nations, where many wear masks against air pollution, mask-wearing became widespread despite the absence of immediate threats.","1602922518","6"
"2528","Mask-wearing has become such a part of daily life that it now plays a role in maintaining an overall feeling of being “reassured” in Japanese society, said Yukiko Iida, an expert on masks at the Environmental Control Center, an environmental consulting company based in Tokyo.","1602922518","6"
"2529","“When you put on a mask, you’re not inconveniencing others when you cough,” Ms. Iida said. “You’re showing others that you’re abiding by social etiquette, and so people feel reassured.”","1602922518","6"
"2530","The debate over masks has focused on the divide between the West and Asia. But even inside the West, sharp differences have emerged.","1602922518","6"
"2531","On March 18, the Czech Republic became the first nation in Europe to make mask-wearing mandatory, followed by Slovakia on March 25. Though neither was used to it, people across both countries mobilized by sewing masks at home, often giving them away to doctors, nurses and shop assistants or leaving them on their doors or gates to offer to passers-by.","1602922518","6"
"2532","In Slovakia, television anchors and politicians took the lead, wearing masks in studios and outside. During the swearing-in ceremony of a new government, President Zuzana Caputova wore a red one that matched her dress, helping to remove the stigma.","1602922518","6"
"2533","“When we both have a face mask, I protect you, you protect me,” said a Czech actress in a widely shared video that featured the country’s minister of health and urged other nations to make masks mandatory.","1602922518","6"
"2534","Slovakia and the Czech Republic were quicker to embrace face masks, experts said, in part because of their Communist legacy’s emphasis on collectivism.","1602922518","6"
"2535","By contrast, in France, where a sense of individualism is stronger, even government officials were long pessimistic about the adoption of mask-wearing against potential epidemics. In fact, so ingrained was the cultural resistance to masks that, as a security measure, France became in 2011 the first European nation to ban the public covering of the face, including with the Muslim veil.","1602922518","6"
"2536","A 2010 report by the French Senate, the upper house of Parliament, noted that the practice had been met with “cultural reluctance that has proved insurmountable in the short term.” It added, “More than an act of individual or altruistic protection, wearing a mask is seen as stigmatizing.”","1602922518","6"
"2537","In 2009, in face of the H1N1 pandemic, France had amassed 1.7 billion masks, but stocks had fallen to 150 million at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a recent report by the academy.","1602922518","6"
"2538","Faced with shortages, which it first denied, the French government discouraged people from wearing masks, saying only the sick should wear them in public and that they were otherwise not useful.","1602922518","6"
"2539","But the recommendations not only failed to convince French people who thronged pharmacies in search of masks, but they also conflicted with images of President Emmanuel Macron wearing a mask when he visited a military field hospital in eastern France on March 25.","1602922518","6"
"2540","Though the French government has yet to make masks mandatory, powerful groups, like the Academy of Medicine, have recommended that they be.","1602922518","6"

"2544","To mask or not to mask?","1603007398","6"
"2545","For the past few months, public health officials have been unyielding in their stance that healthy people should not wear masks as a way to protect themselves from coronavirus.","1603007398","6"
"2546","But with new information about how the virus is spread — potentially through the air and by people with no symptoms — the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday recommended that everyone wear nonmedical face coverings in public settings. President Trump said the guidelines were voluntary, leaving the decision about wearing masks up to individuals. Top health officials, including Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, warned that masks should not replace social distancing and hand washing.","1603007398","6"
"2547","While longtime advocates for mask wearing applaud the shift, they said it should also include a plan for providing masks to the public. For now, commercially made masks are virtually impossible to find. Many people have hoarded masks in recent months, and everyone agrees that any available supply of medical masks should be reserved for hospitals and emergency workers. That means if you want a mask, you probably have to make it yourself.","1603007398","6"
"2548","“We have a $3 trillion stimulus package and a mask costs very little — they should be free,” said Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee, assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University.","1603007398","6"
"2549","Last week, the German Medical Association suggested that citizens find or make a simple fabric mask when out in public and leave medical-grade masks for front-line workers. In Austria, grocery store shoppers are now required to wear masks. In New York City, officials advised residents to shield their faces with a scarf, bandanna or other covering when leaving their homes. ","1603007398","6"
"2550","Dr. Soe-Lin said she didn’t understand why public health officials have been so reluctant to recommend nonmedical fabric masks for the public. Even if they aren’t as protective as a medical mask, they are better than nothing, she said.","1603007398","6"
"2551","“We are in the upswing of a pandemic,” Dr. Soe-Lin said. “These cloth masks are protective. It’s a really important complement to the social-distance and hand-washing instructions.”","1603007398","6"
"2552","The highest-quality, most expensive medical masks — called N95 respirator masks — should be reserved for hospital workers and emergency responders who are regularly exposed to high viral loads from infected patients, both from frequent contact as well as medical procedures that can spew tiny viral particles into air.","1603007398","6"
"2553","If you’re not a health care worker and you have a stash of N95 masks or standard surgical masks, consider donating it to a hospital.","1603007398","6"
"2554","If you’re staying home and nobody in your family is infected, you don’t need a mask most of the time. Studies of mask use to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses, including SARS, another form of coronavirus, show a simple mask can lower risk of infection. The effect is greatest when masks are used along with hand hygiene and social distancing.","1603007398","6"
"2555","“I think the vast amount of data would suggest that the coronavirus is an airborne infection carried by respiratory droplets, and it also can be passed on by direct contact,” said Dr. Mukherjee, who recently wrote an article about how the coronavirus behaves inside patients. “The mask works two ways — not only to protect you from me, but me from you.”","1603007398","6"
"2556","If you decide to start wearing a mask, you should know that it takes some getting used to. A mask can be hot and uncomfortable and fog your glasses if you wear them. But pulling it up and down defeats the purpose of wearing it.","1603007398","6"
"2557","While we don’t have a lot of research on the effectiveness of homemade masks in preventing the spread of infection, scientists who study airborne diseases can offer some guidance. A mask sewn from a pattern or an improvised face covering made with a T-shirt probably offers some protection. The thicker the fabric, the better: think heavy cotton T-shirt or a thick, felt-like fabric, said Dr. Marr, the Virginia Tech aerosol scientist.","1603007398","6"
"2558","“I’ve been saying some protection is better than none,” said Dr. Marr, who noted that local health departments had been asking aerosol scientists for guidance on potential mask materials to deal with supply shortages.

"2559","Dr. Soe-Lin said she believed an added benefit of a mask was that it serves as a constant reminder against touching your face, a major way that the virus is spread. But no face covering, whether it’s homemade or a medical mask, makes you invincible. Pulling a mask on and off or fidgeting with it will lessen its effectiveness. And in theory, fiddling with your mask could contaminate it. Always remove a mask by the ear loops or the tie — never the part that covers your face.","1603007398","6"
"2560","Dr. Soe-Lin said she had used cloth masks for three weeks and washed and dried them regularly. Someone with only one mask can hand wash at night and let it air dry. If a mask gets wet or damp while you are wearing it, it’s less effective, she said.","1603007398","6"

"2562","“I don’t think there is any evidence that this is going to make things worse, but there is evidence that it provides some additional good,” said Robert Hecht, professor at the Yale School of Public Health, who was the co-author of the face mask article with Dr. Soe-Lin. “Under this emergency situation we’re in, it seems, in our view, hard to argue against covering your face. We have large numbers of infections occurring which don’t need to happen if people were to use the masks.”","1603007398","6"
"2563","In the final minutes before the salon reopened, Diamond Herrera, 22, a stylist, and Desi Orr, 19, a receptionist, tested out the no-touch forehead thermometers. Ms. Bodley reminded them of their new operating procedures. (Everyone wears a mask, and stylists must don the hot pink rubber gloves they previously used for messy jobs like dyeing.)

I tried to convince vacation property owners that they could indeed rent to us because we had arrived before the government-mandated tourist ban. (Luckily, I didn’t have to ask the woman with whom I six-foot-distance-chatted on a hike, who sprinted away when I told her where I’d arrived from five weeks earlier.)","1603130370","6"

Nearly face-to-face, I could see for myself how expressive these creatures are. Unlike other whales, belugas have a flexible neck — making it possible for them to turn and look at you — even seemingly nod, like humans. Their bulbous melon heads are also flexible, which allows them to make recognizable facial expressions.","1603130363","6"
"2569","New guidance released to Trump administration employees will require them to wear masks when inside the West Wing, according to an internal memo released on Monday and obtained by The New York Times.","1603158055","6"
"2570","“As an additional layer of protection, we are requiring everyone who enters the West Wing to wear a mask or face covering,” read the memo, which was distributed to staff members through the White House management office.","1603158055","6"
"2571","The new rules are not expected to apply to President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who for weeks have downplayed the need to wear masks, an attitude that had trickled down to staff members. The policy was first reported by The Washington Post.","1603158055","6"
"2572","But hours after the White House instituted the new rule, Mr. Trump denied that any system designed to keep aides safe had broken down. He said he had required that everyone wear masks, insisting that the disease was “very well-contained” at the White House.","1603158055","6"

I talked to him and several other workplace comedy showrunners about what makes their genre so superb. They can’t go to their offices either, so they were all around. And most of them, like me, had small children at home.","1603280600","6"
"2578","The photograph was taken at an angle that looked straight down the pier, collapsing hundreds of feet of space so that the sunbathers appeared to join together as one golden organism with toned muscles, a Celtic back tattoo and a languid smile. The only indications that this was unlike any other spring reverie were the baby blue surgical masks obscuring the faces of two passers-by.","1603413926","6"
"2579","When that photo and others of the pier appeared on Twitter and Instagram, the scene was exposed to another kind of crowd: people shut into their homes, skin drained of vitamin D, their own spring plans frustrated by stay-at-home orders, sickness or grief. Their replies to the posts swarmed with recriminations: The sunbathers were the picture of privilege; the masks in the photo could be counted on one hand; nobody would feel sorry if they died.","1603413926","6"
"2580","Now, we are grieving, afraid and confused. We are desperate for an outlet, and indoor finger-pointing is one of the few hobbies still accessible to those sheltering in place. Joggers have been accused of “manspreading” their droplets across public airways. An infant was scolded for appearing maskless outdoors. Somebody called the cops on a guy for playing the trumpet, describing it as an “instrument that uses saliva and wind.”","1603413926","6"
"2581","There are other cultural messages embedded in these photos, too. The images of people gathering on Florida beaches conjure the dynamics of the Florida Man meme, which delights in the broad-brush painting of Floridians as criminally stupid hicks. The Christopher Street Pier, the site of New York’s viral photos, is practically a gay historic landmark — rainbow flags hang from its lampposts — and the outrage resurrects old tropes that gay men make irresponsible and hedonistic use of the body. Those photos were striking not just because the men in the photos were not wearing masks, but also because they were not wearing shirts.","1603413926","6"
"2582","They have also noted that the existence of the photo means that the photographer was also in the crowded place. Flocking outside on a beautiful day, even under the cloud of the virus, is a pretty universal impulse, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo has recognized that New Yorkers need to do it to maintain our sanity. (He has also ordered the wearing of masks in public only when “unable to maintain” social distance.) What distinguishes the self-appointed enforcers of the crowd are their attitudes. They too may be contributing to the city’s congested public arteries, but at least they don’t like what they see.","1603413926","6"
"2583","Most days I feel like both the shamer and the crowd. I have forgotten to wear a mask, and I have eyed the maskless with suspicion. Both the crowds and the shamers are reacting to the same stressor — a catastrophically incompetent government response, which boils down to warning us all to avoid human contact indefinitely.","1603413926","6"
"2584","Everyone at the track was required to wear a mask, including the jockeys during the races. Trainers, along with one assistant each, were allowed to attend, but not owners. Many of the track’s buildings were closed, and the sprawling facility had just one entrance open.","1603540209","6"
"2585","The crowds were limited to 1,000 fans. Everyone was required to wear a mask, and fans were seated three seats apart, even if they arrived at the game together. There were temperature checks, and no food was served, or allowed to be brought in.","1603540209","6"
"2586","As a trip to the store has come to entail wearing a mask, dodging fellow shoppers and worrying about the risks to store workers, many people are cutting back on visits. Plenty have stopped going altogether, but grocery delivery apps have minimum orders, and some websites sell only large quantities.","1603648679","6"
"2587","But beyond the doors, new and unfamiliar sights await: hand-sanitizer dispensers scattered on every surface, employees smizing through their face masks, signs displaying checklists of “what we’re doing to keep you safe.” When Saks Fifth Avenue reopened in Houston, the store stamped a trail of warnings on its white tile floors, in blocky black text, asking shoppers to “please maintain social distancing of at least six feet from others.”","1603729517","6"
"2588","So far their plans are similar: Employees will wear face masks and submit to health screenings; some store layouts will be reconfigured to create more space and promote one-way traffic flows; customer capacity will be limited; stores will be cleaned more often; hours will be reduced; hand sanitizer will be liberally available; in-store events or any services requiring close contact (beauty tutorials, bra fittings) will be suspended or adapted.","1603729517","6"

"2591","Nordstrom said its strategy for its 116 locations (soon to be 100, with many in suburbia) is to “overcommunicate.” Before reopening, the company wants to prepare shoppers for what to expect by posting photos and videos of the changes on social media. It wants to hold customers’ hands — in a gloved, socially distant kind of way — from the moment they walk in (and are handed a disposable mask) to the moment they check out (behind a plexiglass partition).","1603729517","6"
"2592","Virtual try-ons — technology already used by Sephora and Ulta, among others — could become standard. Employees will need to find new ways of demonstrating how to use products; they may still be able to put eye makeup on a customer (though that could violate social distancing), but lipstick and bronzer can’t be applied behind a face mask. And not everyone will want a high-touch, high-technology experience.","1603729517","6"

"2594","WASHINGTON — The White House on Monday ordered all West Wing employees to wear masks at work unless they are sitting at their desks, an abrupt shift in policy after two aides working near the president — a military valet and Katie Miller, the vice president’s spokeswoman — tested positive for the coronavirus last week.","1603804888","6"

"2600","The new White House policy on masks came as Mr. Trump tried to reinvent his government’s troubled history on testing for the coronavirus, claiming that the United States was “unmatched and unrivaled” in its testing capacity but ignoring the early failures to provide testing that allowed the virus to spread invisibly for months.","1603804888","6"

"2617","A few weeks ago, I spoke, from the recommended distance, to a man named Jacques Cohen. He was seated on the sidewalk outside the IHU, an angular monument of concrete and glass about a mile and a half from Marseille’s old port. Cohen had his back against a pylon and his wrists on his knees, at the edge of a group of perhaps 60 people. By their unworried proximity to one another — they were standing around in a loose group, as people used to, waiting to enter the hospital through a side door — they were identifiable as the unfortunates who already knew they were positive. I had selected Cohen as my interlocutor under the guidance of a nearby nurse. He was not coughing or sneezing; he wore a mask. “In any case, we’re all going to get it,” the nurse said.","1604137885","6"
"2618","I crouched on the pavement and asked Cohen, who is 76, how he was feeling. For the past two days, he had been taking hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. “It’s getting better,” Cohen said through his mask. He looked ashen but optimistic. His fever had fallen, and he had begun to regain his sense of taste. I noted that there was some debate about the efficacy of the treatment. “There’s no ‘believing’ or ‘not believing,’” Cohen replied. “We know it’s effective!”","1604137885","6"
"2619","Maybe some of this defeatism is justified as a judgment on Donald Trump’s inability to lead any kind of wartime effort.

Leadership and industrial capacity can’t just be willed into existence; certain kinds of sclerosis can’t be easily escaped.","1604137817","6"
"2620","But the assumption that decadence is simply inescapable seems decadent itself.

I had planned an elaborate proposal at our favorite restaurant that would be followed by a surprise engagement party where all her friends and family would fly in from across the United States. The original plan was no longer possible, but I didn’t want to postpone. After a restful day at our apartment in Williamsburg, we went for our usual walk along the water at Domino Park to watch the sunset. It was there that I got down on one knee while our good friend (safely) photographed the moment. Everyone around us was wearing masks and keeping their distance, but they all cheered when she said yes. We picked up a bottle of champagne from a local shop and celebrated with family and friends virtually back at home. In this time of anxiety and uncertainty I wanted to show that love wins, always.","1604358500","6"
"2628","After years of dating and living in Washington, San Francisco and Boston, we moved in together in July to Dumbo, Brooklyn. This is our home and I knew I wanted to do it somewhere special. We live on Washington Street with the iconic bridge shot that is normally flooded with tourists. We had planned to travel to Florida to be with her family and then my family was coming up to New York City to celebrate my fathers birthday the following weekend. So I wanted to propose before those events so we could all celebrate. Once I had the blessing from her mother and father, and sister and brother, the plan was in place. The challenge was the pandemic forced both family trips to be canceled, with fear of the virus swarming the city and people fleeing the city I decided I wasn’t going to let a virus get in the way of love — love will go on. We made plans to move out to Long Island for a bit so we were still in proximity to the city for work. On March 26, before we left while we were walking our dog, I had a friend in my building hiding out with an N95 mask on and sunglasses. Before we got in the car to leave the city, I pulled her into the middle of the street and asked her to marry me. She said yes! All of the love from friends and family came pouring in. Everyone was saying this is just what they needed after weeks of coronavirus hysteria and that made it even more special that we brought joy to so many people during this extraordinary time.","1604358500","6"

"2630","Rather, it seems masks are finally getting some respect at the White House. On Monday, the White House Management Office issued a memo requiring all of the staff to wear masks while inside the West Wing except when working at their own desks. Visitors will need to cover their faces as well.","1604466013","6"
"2631","Monday’s mask directive, of course, will not apply to the president or vice president. After all, the primary purpose of a nonmedical mask isn’t to protect the wearer but rather those around him or her, not exactly a top priority for Mr. Trump. Still, it was a notable reversal — and surely a painful concession — by a president who has long made clear his anti-mask bias.","1604466013","6"
"2632","In early April, while announcing the recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that masks be worn in public spaces, Mr. Trump made clear he would not be taking his own administration’s advice. “Wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens — I don’t know,” he said. “Somehow, I don’t see it for myself.”","1604466013","6"
"2633","The president’s apologists are happy to peddle this line. “What Trump is really doing is projecting American strength and health at a time when strong leadership is needed,” The Federalist proclaimed. Noting the importance of “optics,” the article contended that a single photo of a mask-clad Mr. Trump “would signal that the United States is so powerless against this invisible enemy sprung from China that even its president must cower behind a mask.”","1604466013","6"
"2634","Mr. Trump is peddling a fantasy world where he has wrestled the invisible enemy into submission and America is now poised to “transition to greatness” — a perplexing phrase he promised we are “going to hear a lot” in the coming weeks.

"2635","So it was that until this week, Mr. Trump’s mask aversion extended well beyond his person, echoing throughout the White House. Top aides generally eschewed them, as did those who attended meetings with the president or appeared at his daily public briefings. Certainly, Mr. Pence internalized the message, doing public appearances barefaced even after causing a minor scandal by declining to mask up during his visit to the Mayo Clinic last month, explicitly violating the hospital’s policy. Mr. Pence apologized for the infraction, before settling back into masklessness.","1604466013","6"

Some droplets fall to the ground, some hit the sides of the elevator, and some float in the air.","1605168375","6"
"2674","The solution for those of us who must use elevators is to take common sense precautions. First, when possible, avoid riding with another person.

Avoid touching your face after touching elevator buttons, and wash your hands afterward.

"2716","Notice the very American blurring of the constitutional and the theological in that statement. If the Branch Davidians saw the Waco siege as a test, the far-right groups that embraced them as martyrs saw it as a mask-slipping event, in which the federal government’s official concern for public welfare — the suspicions of weapons and child-welfare violations that prompted its initial investigation — fell away to reveal a deep antipathy for individual freedom. If this argument now lacks the punch it had on 1990s talk radio, it’s because conservatives have made an exhausting habit of treating every overextension of government power, however minor, as another Waco — a highly situational outrage that went mysteriously missing when George W. Bush expanded the security state and reliably vanishes during protests against police brutality.","1606217862","6"
"2717","Still, the costs of the lockdown are real and enormous, and the protester raises a legitimate question. The pandemic has cast in stark terms the bargain between the individual and the state, and the sacrifices involved in it. Recent polls have found that a clear majority of Americans — even a bare majority of Republicans — believe stay-at-home orders are not infringing on their constitutional rights. But when New York City’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, arrives with mask-clad police to theatrically break up a Hasidic rabbi’s funeral over social-distancing concerns, he is committing a too-common progressive error: forgetting that even people who approve of the trade-offs implicit in that bargain still recognize them as trade-offs. It explains Waco’s long political half-life beyond the conspiratorial fringe, and the show’s resonance. Nobody likes being ordered to stay in their home, any more than they like being ordered out of it. Telling you it’s for your own good is little comfort, even when it happens to be true.","1606217862","6"

"2720","I’ve worn a mask most of my adult life as a surgeon, and I had been skeptical that masks would play a large role in fighting this pandemic. Most masks don’t have the seal and filtration to protect us from inhaling the coronavirus. But that’s not the only way they work. Masks reduce aerosolized droplet transmission to others and to surfaces that others may touch. They protect your mouth and nose from the droplets of others, and they prevent you from touching your nose and mouth.","1606217832","6"
"2721","Business must adapt. One busy consumer-facing industry has already demonstrated how adapting to a virus-mitigation approach is feasible. Most grocery stores have been safely operating through the pandemic. Many are doing so by limiting the number of shoppers in a store, requiring masks, spacing out lines and alternating registers, installing plexiglass guards, cleaning incessantly and discontinuing some services like self-serve salad bars. The grocers have strict policies for workers with symptoms to not report to work, and some continue to pay them to avoid creating a financial incentive to not disclose symptoms. By adhering to distancing and hygiene standards, these businesses have proved that even at the peak of the pandemic, they can operate without becoming hot spots of contagion. These practices should be expanded to smaller businesses. If it’s not feasible for a business such as a cruise ship or an arcade to function with strict distancing, masks and impeccable hygiene, then that business should remain closed until it’s safe to reopen.","1606217832","6"

During each procedure, he wears a Tyvek suit, a head covering, gloves, a face shield and an N-95 mask. He also sprays the dead body’s nose, mouth and eyes with disinfectant and covers the face with alcohol-soaked paper.

I’m cleaning house like you, but I do that a lot. I’m the Delete Queen. I actually threw out the elusive, desperately needed mask only a month ago. I have no idea why I had a box of them, but I looked at them and tossed them in the bin. Well done, Patti!

"2749","Which brings me to my big worry that for some, resentment and distrust is building. I’m not referring to the lockdown protests or those who’ve politicized the virus to the point where donning a mask means succumbing to tyranny. The resentment I’m worried about is distrust in authorities. Months into the pandemic, some people feel as if the goal posts have been moved. You said to flatten the curve! We made sacrifices!

I miss trying to cram everyone into one car and leaning around our seats to talk to each other, then pulling chairs from a bunch of different tables so we could all sit together.

If one person steps up and explains the importance of using a mask and staying at home whenever possible, people will began to follow them, and society will be impacted for the better. That being said, these leaders need to adopt the suggested practices themselves in order to be a good leader.","1606791714","6"

"2754","My dad has stage four male breast cancer which spread to his brain causing him to be terminal. This COVID situation has been terrible for him because not only does he not want to get sick but he can’t. If my dad ends up getting the virus, his weak immune system will struggle to fight the virus. He has a high risk of death. I have been very cautious about wearing a mask when I go out in public. My friend and her mom have been making us homemade masks which is very sweet.","1606791714","6"
"2755","When ever I go out and get items that my family needs, I normally wear just a mask since the virus can get in through the mouth, eyes, and by breathing in the air of people that are next to you, I don’t touch my face when I’m outside. That’s why I just normally wear a mask cause I feel like I’m able to catch the virus by breathing in the air of people that are around me. Whenever I go on social media apps I see posts of people protesting about the virus and how it’s not that dangerous and that we should all get back to our normal lives. This is terrible since this is a new virus that doctors and scientists don’t understand and people are protesting on how we should get our normal lives.","1606791714","6"

"2757","I have noticed that the few children leaving their homes have not been wearing their masks as routinely. The cause of this neglect may have to do with the fact that the initial research regarding the coronavirus indicated that the older demographic was the one in the most danger. For this reason during the recent mask shortage, I was forced to get a little creative with my ways. As a Muslim woman, I wear a Hijab, which is a head covering. The Hijab normally has some excess fabric that can be used as a mask. Since the CDC and other renowned health organizations have advised that at the bare minimum individuals should employ the use of cloth masks, I have found that the use of a scarf is perfect for the time being.","1606791714","6"
"2758","Most people in my community wears masks and gloves but some don’t. My parent have strict rules about protection because we live in a high risk area. I have only been out once since school is closed down. It was a trip to the supermarket when we need to buy some ingredients for a cake, my mom put goggles, mask and gloves and even think of letting me wear a raincoat. During the trip I did see some weird looks towards us since the coronavirus haven’t really broke out at that time.","1606791714","6"
"2759","Personally I could not care less about wearing a mask, I really do not think they will help me at all. Some people will say they are “important” or “essential” but I disagree. Rules really do not matter either, even though there are big arrows on the floor or big signs outside the building of Walmart that say “stay 6 feet apart” most people do not listen to it. I still hangout with my friends, most teenagers are still hanging out with their friends as well.","1606791714","6"
"2760","I don’t wear a mask when I’m outside. I don’t wear it because I try to stay six feet apart from people. However, I see a lot of people wearing masks, so I don’t know. The civic rules I think we should all follow are to stay away from other people, don’t touch random things on the street that could be infected, and don’t touch your face. I also think that if people are somewhere crowded they should have to wear a mask just to make sure and so that people don’t judge you since you are not wearing a mask and you could infect them. When I go biking or running I try to stay as far away from people as I can by biking around them or going off the sidewalk and onto the street to dodge them.","1606791714","6"
"2761","I notice many people with and without masks, I hear a lot of stories from news, parent, and their friends, and lately I heard that people were protesting in my state without masks which it’s fine to protest but not wearing a mask won’t do anything but more people at risk. And to be honest, wearing a mask while in the public is just as easy as breathing, and not wearing a mask is not JUST putting yourselves at risk but others with families and thousands die a day because of this.","1606791714","6"
"2762","In my community I have noticed that everyone is following the rules about wearing a mask. Here and there I see someone without a mask in the streets. However, most places don’t allow people in without a mask and will often give them one if they enter. Personally, I have been wearing a mask when I have to go out. Although, many people say that masks don’t actually prevent the spread I think out of respect for other people you should still wear it.","1606791714","6"
"2763","In my community, I’ve noticed many people wearing masks at stores, working, but not while going on a walk as a family. I wear masks if I’m going to get food or get groceries. Although I disagree that there is a civic rule regarding mask-wearing, I fully understand that protecting others is crucial to a peaceful community. I do not see people getting angry at each other, fighting, or any sort of disturbance probably because we are all in this together and we need to stay connected.","1606791714","6"
"2764","An overwhelming majority of people in my community seem to wear masks wherever they go. I even see people wearing their masks while in the car, which I do not understand. Why do people feel the need to wear a hot and uncomfortable mask while they are already protected in the privacy of their car? I also do not understand the people who wear masks while walking alone on a quiet street, or even with immediate family. Masks are meant to be worn when social distancing is impossible, like in the supermarket or on the busy streets of the city. My family and I have received some dirty looks when we look like the only people who are not wearing masks, even though we are simply walking outside and keeping our distance from anyone else.","1606791714","6"
"2765","Aside from these practical reasons not to wear a mask, I, for one, feel uncomfortable seeing others in masks and wearing one myself (especially when it is not completely necessary). It is just another reminder that things are different. Change can be very hard; the only people we used to see in masks were doctors and dentists during our occasional visits. Now, all of the sudden, everyone wears masks. I know that I will have to get used to this eventually, but it will not be easy.","1606791714","6"
"2766","I remember going to the grocery store and being completely taken aback by all the people wearing masks. Sure I had seen people wearing masks on the internet, but I didn’t think it was such a widespread thing that had reached my corner of the world. Everyone was wearing masks; both the shoppers as well as the workers who were vigorously wiping down everything. Well … everyone except my Dad, very few other shoppers, and I. We had taken an impromptu stop to pick up a few snacks and didn’t think we would need masks or anything. Kinda regretting my decision. We do have masks for when we’re going on vacation in the summer and need to go to the airport, but haven’t used them out of the house yet. Thankfully I wasn’t kicked out of the store or receive any dirty looks.","1606791714","6"

We’ve changed what we’re doing to ensure that we’re practicing social and physical distancing to keep you safe.”","1607817477","6"
"2838","The C.D.C. recommends wearing masks or cloth face coverings when out in public, to keep people who don’t know they’re sick from spreading the virus by respiratory droplets.

"2842","If you decide to have a play date, health experts recommend several protective measures. First, before anyone comes over, ask the other parents if anyone in their household has any Covid-19 symptoms — though remember that carriers can be asymptomatic. Both parents and kids should practice social distancing or wear masks if they can’t maintain six feet of distance (the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend masks for children under 2). Experts acknowledge that this may not always happen with kids — your child may refuse to wear a mask or rip it off — and that is a risk parents need to consider.","1607841860","6"
"2843","If you decide to take your child to the playground — check your area to make sure they are open — many of the same hygiene rules for play dates apply. As much as possible, your kid should keep social distance or wear a mask (although other children may not wear masks, which leaves your kid less protected). Wash hands or use hand sanitizer often — even more than on a play date — and wipe down equipment before your child uses it. If possible, go when there will be fewer people around.","1607841860","6"
"2844","You also want to make sure your babysitter is symptom-free before coming into your house and have them wash their hands thoroughly when they arrive. Some experts advise that babysitters wear a mask. Dr. Chin-Hong said parents might run potential babysitters through a “coronavirus I.Q. test” before they’re hired. Ask them questions such as: How do you keep yourself safe from Covid-19? What activities are you currently doing? What is your social life like right now? Who do you live with? How will you help prevent my child’s exposure to the virus?","1607841860","6"
"2845","If you still want your family to be tested, contact a health care provider you trust rather than a random clinic. Ask your provider about the limitations of coronavirus antibody tests, and request one that has had F.D.A. oversight. But even if someone in your family gets a positive result — meaning it appears that they’ve had a previous infection with the virus — it shouldn’t change your self-protection measures (social distancing, masks, etc.). “Parents can do it for curiosity,” said Dr. Chin-Hong. “But it is not your passport to start interacting like crazy. It wouldn’t change my behavior at all.”","1607841860","6"
"2846","The different approaches have left many Americans bewildered about what is safe behavior outside. Experts have a simple answer: Practice social distancing and wear a mask when that is not possible.","1607885964","6"
"2847","Experts say that a person walking, jogging or cycling too close for a few seconds is not a big worry. But they recommend joggers wear a mask or some other form of face covering if they’re going to come close to other people. If someone sets up a picnic blanket within your six-foot perimeter and plans to stay a while, that’s a bigger concern. Try to avoid a confrontation. That only increases your risk of exposure. Such conflicts could spike as more people head outside.","1607885964","6"

"2850","Experts said that although outdoor restaurant patrons can’t wear masks while eating, servers should. The main risk of exposure is if the guests within a few feet at the table aren’t from your household. Sitting and talking for extended periods of time as well as sharing food and common serving utensils are also potential sources of exposure if one of the guests is infected and doesn’t know it.","1607885964","6"

"2858","The government’s flip-flopping policies on past pandemics had left a once formidable national stockpile of face masks nearly depleted. Officials had also outsourced the manufacturing capacity to replenish that stockpile to suppliers overseas, despite warnings since the early 2000s about the rising risks of global pandemics.","1608942069","6"
"2859","That has left France — unlike Germany, its rival for European leadership — dependent on foreign factories and painfully unable to ramp up domestic production of face masks, test kits, ventilators and even the thermometers and over-the-counter fever-reducing medicines to soothe the sick.","1608942069","6"
"2860","France had long identified masks as indispensable in a pandemic, yet the government had mostly stopped stockpiling them during the past decade, mainly for budgetary reasons. Domestic production collapsed at the same time the country’s pharmaceutical industry was also moving overseas.","1608942069","6"
"2861","But the scope and speed of the coronavirus defied that logic. Still reeling from its own outbreak, China, the world’s leading maker of masks, was overwhelmed with orders. India, a top exporter of medication, temporarily banned exports for fear of shortages.","1608942069","6"
"2862","As the globalized supply chain broke down, French health officials lost critical time as the national government — as well as cities, towns and even wards — scrambled to buy supplies directly from China and elsewhere. The government organized highly publicized airlifts of masks from China, betraying both its desperation and its dependence.","1608942069","6"
"2863","In the aftermath of the SARS pandemic in Asia in 2003, French officials analyzed the risks in a series of reports and built up a national stockpile of masks and other protective equipment manufactured by domestic suppliers — in keeping with a Gaullist tradition of maintaining a strong domestic defense industry that also exports Rafale fighter jets, submarines, minesweepers and frigates to the world.","1608942069","6"
"2864","In 2006, a government pandemic plan recommended a series of measures, including creating stockpiles of masks. A year earlier, France’s Health Ministry signed a five-year contract to buy 180 million masks a year that Bacou-Dalloz, then the biggest mask maker in France, would produce at a factory in Plaintel, about 280 miles from Paris.","1608942069","6"
"2865","The contract would ensure the government’s “renewal of its stockpile of masks” as older stocks reached their expiration dates. And during a pandemic, the government could requisition the plant’s production.","1608942069","6"
"2866","But soon afterward, many politicians began criticizing the policy of stockpiling masks and medication as wasteful. About 383 million euros spent in 2009 on acquiring 44 million vaccinations against the H1N1 flu caused a political scandal after less than 9 percent of French people were vaccinated.","1608942069","6"
"2867","In 2013, the General Secretariat for Defense and National Security issued new pandemic directives emphasizing “overall savings” and reducing the importance of maintaining a stockpile. Surgical masks would be stocked, but not the more sophisticated FFP2 masks that, the report noted, cost 10 times as much.","1608942069","6"
"2868","The directives also transferred the responsibility — and costs — for securing and stockpiling masks to public and private employers. This contributed to the severe shortages that France has suffered in recent months, as government officials became less engaged on the issue.","1608942069","6"
"2869","Mr. Gautier, the former director of the general secretariat, said that the new directives had been intended to improve the distribution of masks by requiring employers, like hospitals, to stock them and to make them legally responsible for the protection of their employees.","1608942069","6"
"2870","But the new policy also undermined France’s capacity to produce masks. Employers, now charged with procuring masks, naturally sought cheaper suppliers abroad.","1608942069","6"
"2871","And to save costs, the government placed large orders that only Chinese factories were able to satisfy, said Francis Delattre, a former senator whose 2015 report warned of the depletion of masks.","1608942069","6"
"2872","As expired masks were disposed of, France’s national stockpile shrank from 1.7 billion in 2009 to 150 million in March.","1608942069","6"
"2873","And as the “invisible enemy” began rampaging throughout France, the country that made some of the world’s most sophisticated military hardware in the world was unable to produce enough face masks.","1608942069","6"
"2874","The anxiety of the nurses manning these checkpoints is often palpable. Decked out with face mask, full face shield and full protective gown, a nurse checking me in was so overwrought, she began to cry as she asked, “Are you having any trouble breathing?”","1609257703","6"
"2875","So, patients sit by themselves in the waiting room. They fidget in light blue leather chairs measured six feet apart.

Burger King executives are reviewing designs for masks that might become a standard part of the uniform.

"2892","For some diners, seeing staff members wearing masks is a comfort. For others, the masks provoke anxiety, he said. If guests ask to be waited on by someone without a mask, and the waiter is willing, the restaurant will accommodate them.","1610046733","6"
"2893","“We invite all of our guests to have fun on their own terms,” Mr. O’Connell said. “It is always our ultimate goal to be healers. We’ve created a sanctuary, a place which is nurturing, and a mask for some people is a symbol of that and for others it is not.”","1610046733","6"
"2894","Masks can be a political flash point. On Mother’s Day, hundreds of people without masks crowded into C & C Breakfast & Korean Kitchen in Castle Rock, Colo., south of Denver, for a protest party organized by the owners, who said the state government had overstepped by limiting restaurants to takeout and delivery, and requiring workers to wear face masks. The state health department closed the restaurant the next day.","1610046733","6"
"2895","In Texas, masks are recommended but not required, although some local laws are stricter. The Hillstone Restaurant Group, which runs 45 restaurants in several states, decided that its Texas servers would not wear masks in part because the face wear didn’t match the style of service. A server sued; a judge issued a temporary restraining order and is expected to make a final ruling on May 20. That, and growing pressure on social media, led to a shift in the policy.","1610046733","6"

"2920","Some of it comes from right-wing crazies. Only a small minority of Americans believes that freedom includes the right to endanger other people’s lives (which is what congregating in large groups in the midst of a pandemic does); that wearing a mask is un-American, or unmanly, or something; that Covid-19 is a hoax perpetrated by liberals.

"2924","The economics of a show that prioritizes social distancing played out here, as a full staff of nearly 30 employees worked a house that was 80 percent empty.

"2933","At the beginning of our lockdown in March I walked from Letna across Cech Bridge, down Parizska street and then to Marianske Namesti where I was bringing some masks to the Red Cross. It was really quite strange. The first thing was that I saw Charles Bridge from Letna, and I know the view very well — I normally go that way every day. On Charles Bridge there was nothing to be seen other than the statues, which was very bizarre. That view will stay with me until my death, because it was really nice weather and there weren’t any people out at all. It was about two weeks into the quarantine and we were already used to there being little traffic. And really, Charles Bridge — to see only the statues on it, that was just it for me.","1610624130","6"

But, in any case, I go into stores the same way you do. I have a short list. I go in during the senior hour. I use gloves and a mask. In fact, I use a double mask to go in the store just in case somebody comes too close to me. And I go to stores that have a good setup. They monitor how many people go in.

"2980","For one Rikers Island correction officer, the low point came when he and his wife were both extremely sick with the coronavirus. She could hardly breathe and begged him to make sure she was not buried in a mass grave, he recalled. He was sure he had contracted the disease working in the jailhouse, where supervisors had discouraged him from wearing a mask.","1611574809","6"
"2981","Another officer at the Rikers jail said he worked for nearly two weeks while feeling ill but received no help from the jail’s administrators in getting a test. A third, who delivered mail to people in custody, some of them sick, was told he could not use a mask that he had at home but had to wait for a city-issued one. He, too, became infected.","1611574809","6"

"2983","The city correction commissioner, Cynthia Brann, in testimony last week before the Board of Correction, a watchdog agency overseeing the jails, said all staff members are screened for fever when they arrive at work, common areas are sanitized daily and everyone in the jails has been required to wear masks since April 3.","1611574809","6"
"2984","Without a positive test result, he was required by his superiors to continue to work, and his symptoms worsened, he said. He had a cough and was sneezing. He did not have a mask, he said, or access to hand sanitizer.","1611574809","6"
"2985","Yet, few jail staff members had received masks, he said.","1611574809","6"
"2986","On his rounds, he walked through areas where inmates were being tested for Covid-19 without a mask. His supervisors had told him, he said, that he could not wear a mask he had at home, without saying why.","1611574809","6"
"2987","At the end of March he received a mask from the city, but no gloves. Two days later, he developed a cough, a sore throat and he felt dizzy. He knew he had delivered mail to people in custody who had the virus, including Harvey Weinstein, the movie producer convicted of rape.","1611574809","6"
"2988","Ms. Brann, who declined multiple requests for an interview, said in her testimony that she first required some jail staff members and people in custody to wear masks starting on March 11, a month before doing so was recommended for the general public. By April 3, she said, everyone in the jail was required to wear them.","1611574809","6"
"2989","That change came a day before a judge ordered the city to provide officers protective gear, union leaders said. Guards in jailhouses housing people with the coronavirus are given high-quality N95 masks. The rest receive surgical masks. A Board of Correction report released last week said some inmates and guards were either not wearing the masks or wearing them incorrectly.","1611574809","6"
"2990","At work he wore an N95 mask that he had purchased. He stuffed alcohol pads into his pocket and as many plastic gloves into his waistband as would fit. He hooked a small bottle of hand sanitizer onto his belt. When he got to his post, he frantically cleaned the desk and phone with an alcohol pad.","1611574809","6"
"2991","Worried about being reprimanded, he went back to work several weeks ago against his doctor’s wishes, he said. He said not much had changed. The department has supplied him with a surgical mask, but he still buys his own N95 masks at inflated prices.","1611574809","6"
"2992","The Rev. Peter Purpura walked slowly down the middle of a street lined with brick rowhouses in Middle Village, Queens. He wore a black cassock, white vestments and a light blue surgical mask as he led a procession.","1611574808","6"
"2993","So as a first step, think about human contacts, big and small, by every member of the household. How many times did someone go to a store? Did you meet up with a friend for a walk? When you jog, how close are you to other runners? At the park, did your children run up to another child before you could stop them? Is a teenage boyfriend dropping by the house? Do you always wear a mask? Do your children?","1611696298","6"
"2994","Now that you’ve taken stock, try to seal the “leaks” in your quarantine bubble. While it may be impossible to get your contact risk to zero, you can eliminate the biggest risks (like outside visitors), reduce shopping trips to once a week or less, improve hand hygiene and wear a mask. Once you’re confident in your family’s quarantine vigilance for 14 days, it’s less risky to visit an older family member. But go with a plan.","1611696298","6"
"2995","The safer strategy is to spend time together outdoors — the risk for viral transmission outside is far lower than inside. Everyone should wash their hands, and stay at least six feet apart. Some experts suggest 10 to 12 feet if the grandparent is a very elderly person or has a chronic health condition. Even outdoors, everyone over the age of 2 — and not just the grandparent — should wear a mask. Children are more likely to wear a mask if you explain to them that it’s to protect someone they love.","1611696298","6"
"2996","“A sneeze without a mask can spread up to 20 feet,” said Dr. Asaf Bitton, executive director of Ariadne Labs at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “It’s also the act of speaking — we expel droplets even in quiet speech. The mask really contains a great amount of them. The mask is protecting all of us from each other.”","1611696298","6"
"2997","Remember, the biggest worry is being in an enclosed space with someone who has the virus but doesn’t know it. Keep everyone outside, if possible. But if a child must enter a grandparent’s house, monitor them and allow it only when the grandparent is outside. Everyone should wear a mask, and sanitize the bathroom after use. If the grandparent is visiting you, designate one disinfected bathroom just for them and keep children outdoors.","1611696298","6"
"2998","“Parents can explain the need to keep grandparents from getting sick by keeping their body to themselves, staying behind a particular landmark like a sidewalk or set of chairs, and keeping a mask on their faces since germs come from there,” Dr. Chaudhary said. “Young kids generally understand the idea of something bad happening and trying to do good instead.”","1611696298","6"
"2999","Don’t panic if a child breaches the social distancing barrier and gets close to a grandparent. Brief encounters are not a big risk, and you don’t want to create fear in children. But long hugs, cuddles and sitting in grandpa or grandma’s lap are not advised. If both grandparent and child are wearing a mask, a quick hug from a child around the waist or knees, keeping faces as far apart as possible, poses very little risk, Dr. Marr said.","1611696298","6"
"3000","Long-distance visits to see grandparents are more difficult. You should stay in a hotel or rental nearby, not in the grandparent’s house, and still limit visits to the outdoors while wearing a mask. Even if you drive instead of fly, stopping for food and using public restrooms along the way sets your quarantine clock back to zero. It’s safest to quarantine for 14 days before visiting the older person.","1611696298","6"
"3001","My mother became ill with Covid nearly two weeks after a nurse on her floor tested positive. After my video chat with her on the day Mom tested positive, I realized how dire the situation had become. The aide who held the iPad wore only a thin flimsy mask, not the respirator masks we have grown accustomed to seeing on health care workers treating highly contagious patients.","1611696248","6"
"3002","I remember that time when we’d beaten the pandemic. That’s what we thought, anyway, for a few weeks in late winter: That Singapore had conquered the novel coronavirus without lockdowns or widespread mask use, without even closing the schools.","1611696251","6"
"3003","The first known cases came into the city with Chinese tourists in January and trickled slowly through the community, sending out waves of fear. Each day added a handful of new confirmed cases to the running tally — three one day, seven the next, then three again and so on. But somehow the pandemic never mushroomed the way we had feared it would. After two months, there were 509 confirmed cases, and only two people had died. Cinemas and bars had stayed open, restaurants and open-air food courts were crowded and people still browsed malls and markets. Testing was relatively sparse; we were instructed not to wear masks unless we were ill; there was no lockdown. The government pushed homespun common sense — lots of reminders to wash hands and stay home if sick. At the same time, it leveraged the tight controls for which Singapore is known — elaborate surveillance, police investigators, the threat of criminal prosecution — to trace and isolate anybody who caught the virus or had been in close contact with a confirmed patient.","1611696251","6"
"3004","From the earliest cases of the novel coronavirus, the government made it clear that lack of cooperation with health officials would be treated as a crime. Ordinary, errant Singaporeans have been showily prosecuted, photographed outside the court, their misdeeds blasted on the news as a warning. A man who had been quarantined upon returning from a trip to Myanmar, then ventured to a food court for pork-rib stew, got six weeks in jail. A shopper who cursed in a supermarket argument over face masks could get a prison sentence. A Singapore citizen who traveled to Indonesia in violation of his stay-at-home notice had his passport suspended.","1611696251","6"
"3005","All schools, most businesses and even some doctors’ offices are closed; masks are mandatory; shopping is permitted only for absolute necessities like food or medicine. At this writing, nearly all of the new cases are concentrated in the dormitories, whose residents are shut away as they undergo systematic screenings. As of May 19, Singapore counted a total of 28,794 confirmed cases and 22 deaths. The daily toll of new cases was down to 451; 450 of them were among migrant workers. The lockdown is now scheduled to lift in early June; it’s not clear what this will mean for the ailing corps of migrant laborers. Singapore is now, more than ever, divided into two cities, two populations: the foreign workers in dormitories, and the rest of us.","1611696251","6"
"3006","One afternoon, government representatives with cardboard boxes arrived in the pavilion overlooking the swimming pool. We stood in a long, winding line to receive our free masks, one for each resident, presenting our ID cards to be scanned. With a strange mix of gratitude and chagrin, thinking of the American nurses and doctors who sometimes lacked the equipment to protect themselves, I accepted our reusable masks from Singapore’s ultraorganized state bureaucracy. This was repeated at housing blocks and community centers around the city. Once they were satisfied that everyone had a mask, the failure to wear one was declared a crime.","1611696251","6"
"3007","On the first day of the new mask law, our family set out for a morning run on the hilly, tree-lined path that winds a ring around our condominium. My husband paused at the door. We should take the masks, he remembered. I waved this suggestion away — it was too hot, and I’d read the law: Masks weren’t required while jogging or even walking briskly. I did not realize, that first morning, just how strictly the new law would be observed.","1611696251","6"
"3008","“Why aren’t you wearing a mask?” she yelled.","1611696251","6"
"3009","I began to argue with her. I told her she was harassing me. She continued to yell about masks. But even as we bickered, an ugly foreboding filled my gut. My clothes were soaked with sweat, but could I actually prove I’d been running? When she turned heel and stalked away, I followed her. “I have your picture!” I informed the tilted dome of her retreating parasol. “Do what you want,” came the muffled reply.","1611696251","6"

He was driving around the Venice Beach area of Los Angeles in his Ford Expedition when he spotted a star: Tim Robbins, on his bike, wearing a mask. Mr. Harrison politely hung up and got his shots.","1611696215","6"
"3013","When he called back, he explained that widespread mask wearing has actually not impeded his ability to recognize celebrities on his daily drives around the west side of Los Angeles — Santa Monica, Brentwood, Pacific Palisades — where the rich and famous live.","1611696215","6"

"3017","Late last week, as she was leading the charge to push the Democrats’ $3 trillion pandemic relief package through the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi strode the floor of the Capitol in a fuchsia pantsuit, red pumps, white shell — and a coordinated red, white and green cherry-print face mask.","1611696213","6"
"3018","This was the day after Ms. Pelosi had stood at a podium for a news conference in a black dress with a complementary dark green and white foliage-print face mask — which was itself not long after she had appeared in a shell-pink pantsuit with a matching shell-pink mask.","1611696213","6"
"3019","Hillary Clinton took note, posting a photo on Instagram with the caption: “Leader of the House majority, and of mask-to-pantsuit color coordination.” The post has been liked more than 250,000 times.","1611696213","6"
"3020","Since late April, when she began wearing silk scarves that were color-coordinated with her suits and shells — orange and orange, blue and blue and cream and brown — and that she had worn bandanna-style around her face, Ms. Pelosi has also modeled a purple suit with a purple/blue, black and white geometric face mask and a white suit and blue shirt with the same.","1611696213","6"
"3021","And though it would be easy to categorize Ms. Pelosi’s masks as fun! and all about self-expression! and — yes — fashion!(as many style watchers have done), her track record and the way her approach contrasts with those around her suggest something more nuanced — though the stratagem is covered, natch, by the accessibility of patterned cloth, the kind we all have to wear and to which we can all relate.","1611696213","6"
"3022","After all, why simply don a face mask when you can also use it to make a political point?","1611696213","6"
"3023","Indeed, the sheer variety of her masks stands out like a beacon amid her sea of aides in generic white or blue medical masks and her dark-masked protective detail. It suggests a commitment to consciously choosing a mask every single day that, more than simply demonstrating good mask habits, civic awareness and solicitude for those around her, or even support for small businesses, demands attention. (Many of her masks come from Donna Lewis, a small store in Alexandria, Va., where she also buys some of her suits; for each mask sold, one is donated to Johns Hopkins hospitals.)","1611696213","6"
"3024","As the president continues to eschew the mask in his public appearances — over the weekend he went without one when meeting in the Rose Garden with Girl Scouts and small business leaders — Ms. Pelosi is making her mask-wearing, and the contrast with those around her, impossible to ignore. Doing so is a constant reminder of the difference between the heads of the executive and legislative branches.","1611696213","6"
"3025","Ms. Pelosi is not the first government official to match her masks to her outfit. That honor goes to the Slovakian president, Zuzana Caputova, whose image went viral in late March at the swearing in of her new coalition government when she wore a burgundy face mask that coordinated perfectly with her burgundy sheath dress. And, apparently, she instructed her new cabinet to wear identical masks (blue) and gloves (white) for the group photo, hence both distinguishing herself from the group and creating a perfectly harmonious picture of civic care.","1611696213","6"

As did Ivanka Trump, who wore a black mask with a black jumpsuit to tour a Maryland produce distributor last week (though that mask had the effect of making her look unsettlingly like a movie bank robber, despite the little American flag pin on the side).","1611696213","6"
"3028","And though most of Congress has now been converted to mask-wearing, as the recent Senate hearings on Covid-19 revealed, with Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina modeling a University of North Carolina booster mask and Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, a red-and-black tie-dye bandanna. Still, they mostly seem to have resorted to the gimmick mask, the current equivalent of the gimmick tie (see also Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and his Washington Nationals mask), the patriot mask (Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina in a stars and stripes and eagles number) or the OK-I’ll-wear-it-if-I-have-to face mask that Vice President Mike Pence wore when he visited the General Motors and Ventec ventilator production plant in Indiana last month.","1611696213","6"
"3029","But no other elected official has embraced the mask with as much relentless and considered eye-catching range as Ms. Pelosi.","1611696213","6"

"3033","Amid global shortages, the city’s public hospital system has centralized ordering of once common items, including disposable protective gear.

"3034","Last Friday, employees discussed a list of long-delayed orders for N95 masks. Danielle DiBari, senior vice president of supply chain, interrupted the meeting to call a vendor who had failed to deliver millions of them.

"3035","Seeing photos of people flouting social distancing, Dr. Wei said, “does feel a little bit like an insult to what we went through as a health care system and health care workers.

"3037","On Monday, fans of the country musician Travis McCready experienced the nation’s first live concert in months. Some drove for hours to attend the Arkansas show, where they had their temperatures taken and wore masks. Four of every five seats were kept empty. The show offered a preview of what live music might look like for the foreseeable future.","1611807469","6"
"3038"," There was no toilet paper or hand sanitizer. Pasta, flour and even yeast could be hard to find in the early weeks of social distancing, as many people decided to take up baking. Of far greater concern, hospitals could not buy enough of the masks, gowns and ventilators required to safely treat Covid-19 patients.","1611894165","6"
"3039","One current example is the N95 face mask. At the onset of the pandemic, hospitals had long-term contracts to buy them for about 35 cents each, an executive at a New York hospital told me. When the need for the masks surged, these suppliers were not allowed to raise the price, even if inclined to do so.","1611894165","6"
"3040","But others along the supply chain could make big profits by diverting masks to anyone willing to pay top dollar. That left hospitals in a bind. As the coronavirus spread in New York, the executive’s hospital searched frantically for masks, eventually paying an overseas supplier $6 each, for hundreds of thousands of them, when the regular stock was desperately short.","1611894165","6"
"3041","When anyone tries to reap big profits in an emergency like this, it can look ugly. Consider the case of two brothers who began buying hand sanitizer, masks and other scarce commodities on March 1, the day of the first announcement of a Covid-19 death in the United States. After they sold some of their merchandise at big markups on Amazon and eBay, these outlets cut them off. Eventually, after considerable adverse publicity, the brothers decided to donate their supplies.","1611894165","6"
"3042","But which people “truly need” N95 masks? What is the right allocation of masks among well-endowed research hospitals, poorly funded municipal facilities, nursing homes and food processing plants? Supply and demand would tell us that the masks should simply go to the buyer who was willing and able to pay the most for them. But fairness tells us this can’t be the only consideration.","1611894165","6"
"3043","That’s why, she said, it’s critical that people who are asymptomatic don’t simply seek out a test that, if negative, might lead them to be less vigilant about wearing a mask or maintaining their distance from others.","1611894149","6"
"3044","There are early signs that might be true. Disney reopened its theme park in Shanghai recently, and quickly sold out of tickets.

"3046","I was hesitant from the start. Nothing about sitting in an enclosed public space for an extended period and eating food made on surfaces I haven’t personally scoured seemed like fun.

"3047","After I hit “confirm” on my online reservation I started asking myself even more of these questions, all of them portending awkwardness. Should I wear a mask? I wear a mask whenever I’m in public — it feels reckless not to. OK, so I wear the mask. But I’ll be … eating? Am I supposed to put it on and take it off in between bites and sips? Is that idiotic? Or is it simply being respectful of the restaurant staff? Or is my mere presence as a patron idiotic and reckless? Dining out — a relaxing treat!","1612393547","6"
"3048","I emailed the restaurant before the reservation about its mask policy. I was hoping for some strict guidance but the owners had none, leaving it to staff and patrons to decide individually. They were gracious and lovely, but also unwilling to set that policy themselves. They’re trying to walk a fine line in the hope of making everyone comfortable.","1612393547","6"
"3049","In Montana, restaurants have to comply with phased reopening guidelines — reservations only, 50 percent capacity, tables six feet apart, no bar seating, no cash. But other procedures (temperature checks, masks) are not required, which means the choice is passed down, until it ends up with the consumer.","1612393547","6"

"3060","It was late March, with the coronavirus starting to peak in New York and hospitals already running short on supplies, when Bethenny Frankel, the entrepreneur and reality television star, received an email from a publicist offering her access to 500 million medical masks, or about enough to fill 25 Madison Square Gardens.","1612783884","6"
"3061","Ms. Frankel was intrigued. While spending eight seasons on the “Real Housewives of New York City,” she began flying to places like Guatemala and the Bahamas to aid in disaster relief. Now, with the disaster down the road, she wanted to help. She called the New York governor’s office, and her home state drafted her to find masks.","1612783884","6"
"3062","“There is no mask store,” she said. “I was ready to get them from a guy in Washington Square Park.”","1612783884","6"
"3063","So began Ms. Frankel’s journey into the market for masks, a sort of high-stakes house of mirrors, where lives and millions of dollars were on the line and things were rarely what they seemed.","1612783884","6"
"3064","The coronavirus arrived in America early this year, and demand for hand sanitizer, face masks and other supplies skyrocketed. With suppliers unable to keep up, and federal officials slow to respond, local governments, hospitals and individuals scrambled to compete for the dwindling supply, causing prices to soar and luring both do-gooders and opportunists.","1612783884","6"
"3065","That offer for 500 million masks was enticing but flawed: The supplies were abroad and would take at least a week to arrive. Ms. Frankel’s government contacts needed gear immediately and she was wary of faraway masks, so she asked Mr. Uhlenkott if he knew of any caches already on the continent.","1612783884","6"
"3066","A day later, he told her he had found five million masks made by the manufacturer 3M, the gold standard, in Canada. Ms. Frankel confirmed with New York State officials that they were interested. And like that, a deal was on.","1612783884","6"
"3067","So when the coronavirus began to appear in American headlines, celebrities including Billy Joel, Ellen DeGeneres and Charlize Theron began funneling their money to her charity to turn it into masks for hospitals. When word spread that she was buying masks, sellers flooded her with offers.","1612783884","6"
"3068","Mr. Uhlenkott had started selling masks that week. A pianist and former field director for Rick Santorum’s 2012 presidential campaign, he canceled plans to record his first album in Los Angeles and decamped to his family’s home in the Idaho wilderness when the virus arrived. There, like thousands of other suddenly idle people, he saw a business opportunity in masks.","1612783884","6"
"3069","While Mr. Uhlenkott tried to secure the five million masks in Canada, his suppliers told him they had found 10 million 3M masks, this time in New York. Officials in Albany wanted those, too, so Ms. Frankel’s team sent him an $82.5 million purchase order for the now 15 million masks, contingent on inspection. It was more than five times the normal price.","1612783884","6"
"3070","Two days later, Mr. Uhlenkott sent blurry photos and a video of boxes in a warehouse that didn’t look like the masks they had agreed upon. Ms. Frankel was suspicious. “You better be able to prove what you have been selling,” she said in a text message.","1612783884","6"
"3071","In an interview, Mr. Uhlenkott said his original source for the 500 million masks was real and reliable, but to find supply already in North America, he went with a new seller who turned out to be slippery. “It seemed like everything was a shell, offshore, this kind of stuff,” he said of the source. “But at the same time it was like, well, maybe those are the people that actually have the masks.”","1612783884","6"
"3072","The first time they spoke, Ralph Frengel put Ms. Frankel at ease. He was a smooth-talking salesman for a company called Astoria Enterprises. He had plenty of masks available and he seemed like a dealmaker. “It felt legitimate,” she said.","1612783884","6"
"3073","On April 3, Mr. Frengel sent a menu of sorts, including eight separate stockpiles that together totaled 275 million 3M masks. “Let me know what you think you can do from this inventory,” he said in an email.","1612783884","6"
"3074","Ms. Frankel alerted her contacts in government. This time, New York City was on board, as BuzzFeed News reported. They agreed to buy 10 million 3M masks for $66.5 million — a high price — once they were inspected.","1612783884","6"
"3075","Ms. Frankel and city officials balked. They wanted to see the masks. In an email, the lawyer representing Ms. Frankel’s team told Mr. Frengel that without immediate inspection “we will be forced to conclude, as the City of New York already believes, that the representations made about the existence and number of 3M N95 masks are untrue.”","1612783884","6"
"3076","Each time a pallet of masks is inspected, “it then must be re-shrink-wrapped, taken across the warehouse, weighed and the manifest tag must be dated, and updated over and over again,” he said. “The suggestions made yesterday afternoon did not sit well with some of Astoria’s principal investor/owners.”","1612783884","6"
"3077","Three weeks after she was first pitched 500 million masks, Ms. Frankel exited the deal empty-handed. “We all were completely gutted,” she said.","1612783884","6"
"3078","Michael Carnicle, the Astoria official in control of the mask supply, served three years in prison in the 1980s after getting caught with $1 million in counterfeit bills. A federal court later found that he had helped fake certificates of deposits from a Russian bank to prop up a company that wanted to turn the 1990s TV hit “American Gladiators” into a Las Vegas show. Most recently, he went to prison for not filing his tax returns. He was released in January.","1612783884","6"
"3079","When I first reached Mr. Frengel and asked if he sold masks, he replied, “I don’t think so. I’d have to look back through my records.” When I said I had spoken with Ms. Frankel, he admitted he was a mask middleman but denied advertising millions of masks, despite numerous emails showing he did. “I just probably forwarded an email,” he said.","1612783884","6"
"3080","In reality, he was pitching Astoria’s stockpiles around the country. Paul Echevarria, a Florida businessman who manufactures cannabidiol, or CBD, said he went down a weeklong rabbit hole with Mr. Frengel and Astoria for millions of 3M masks supposedly stored in a Miami warehouse. Mr. Echevarria planned to resell the masks to the Florida government and had state officials ready to inspect them, but Mr. Frengel wouldn’t provide an address.","1612783884","6"
"3081","Yet none of the men could say for sure whether the masks they were selling even existed.","1612783884","6"
"3082","Mr. Alter, Astoria’s C.E.O., told me, “Sir, this is something that is really confidential, but yes, we have access to millions of masks.” When I asked him Astoria’s source, he laughed. “Where am I getting my product?” he said. “I think it’s funny.”","1612783884","6"
"3083","He forwarded documents suggesting Astoria had plans to buy masks from two other companies. One firm was offering 310 million 3M masks, which is more than what 3M produces in three months. The other company was days old and run by an Indiana man who had once faced federal fraud charges.","1612783884","6"
"3084","No, Mr. Carnicle said. He hadn’t seen the masks.","1612783884","6"
"3085","Thousands of people have entered the mask market over the past two months, and a large chunk of them have been offered millions of 3M masks. Courtney Enloe, 3M’s head of litigation, said probably all of those cases are frauds.","1612783884","6"
"3086","“The typical scheme is somebody will reach out and say we need $X million up front for Y stash of respirators, and they just never had them,” Ms. Enloe said. “I have been solicited. The head of 3M’s litigation has been solicited.” Over the past several weeks, 3M has filed 10 lawsuits against people claiming falsely to have access to its masks.","1612783884","6"
"3087","Federal authorities have also charged several people in recent weeks, including a Georgia man who demanded upfront payments from the Department of Veterans Affairs for $750 million of 3M masks and other gear that he knew didn’t exist.","1612783884","6"
"3088","Amid all this fraud, there is some good news. Ms. Frankel’s BStrong charity and its partner organization, Global Empowerment Mission, have donated more than two million masks and isolation gowns to hospitals and other groups in all 50 states. They cobbled together supplies from smaller purchases and also closed several larger deals, including one million hazmat suits for New York State and 200,000 surgical masks for New York City.","1612783884","6"

"3144","Retail as a whole has declined rapidly over the last two months, but one segment of the struggling industry has defied the trend: face masks. In early April, the Centers for Disease Control began encouraging Americans to wear face masks outside their homes. By then, a crop of do-it-yourself solutions had already emerged, intended to abate shortages of medical-grade personal protective equipment among those on the front lines of the fight against the coronavirus. More than a month later, it’s apparent that social distancing — and thus, mask-wearing — will continue to be necessary throughout the summer.

People hang out in front of their places, talking, walking and laughing together, playing cards, bartering, fixing things inside their tents. More than half the people we see are wearing some kind of mask, either around their faces or dangling from their necks. They’re aware of the virus, and trying. But there’s an overabundance of life here, and an overabundance of caution is impossible.

"3197","On Thursday, as China played King Kong with Hong Kong; as unemployment rose to 38.6 million; as broken dams unleashed a flood in Central Michigan; as the president continued to stubbornly and recklessly claim he was taking hydroxychloroquine, causing sales to soar; as the news sank in that if the U.S. had acted even a week sooner on social distancing that 36,000 people might still be alive; as Senate Republicans finally cemented themselves to Trump and his crazy schemes; as Trump stuck to his threat of withholding federal funds to Michigan and Nevada if those states enabled voters to vote; as a partisan know-nothing was put in charge of all our intelligence; as Trump pulled out of another major arms control pact; as Mike Pompeo basked in getting Trump to fire another inspector general (this one looking into a backdoor deal to sell arms to Saudi Arabia and brazen grifting by the Pompeos), the cliffhanger president made sure the focus was on just one little thing: Would he or wouldn’t he wear a mask as he toured the Ford plant in Ypsilanti?","1614894897","6"
"3198","After donning it for a few private moments with Ford executives, Trump removed the mask for the public part of the tour, saying he “didn’t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it.”","1614894897","6"
"3199","While you know Barack Obama would have been all about the mask, showing the nation the proper example, Trump is afraid his followers will think he’s a wimp if he wears it, that he’s conceding the danger of a pandemic many in MAGA-land think is exaggerated or some sort of hoax.","1614894897","6"
"3200","The mask should be a medical signal, not a political one. But Trump rejects the mask because of a misbegotten image of masculinity and power. In denying the mask, he denies reality, science and the fact that the country is in a crouch. Trump has proved that people wearing a mask can present more truth than people not wearing a mask.","1614894897","6"
"3201","His latest con, something that he stupidly refers to as “Obamagate,” a scandal about unmasking, is also misbegotten. You can’t create a scandal about Obama out of nothing just because you hate the fact that he went by the book while you dwell in a murky world of transgressions, that he glides while you lurch.","1614894897","6"
"3202","Even as Trump tries to paint Joe Biden as gaga, he is doing something truly gaga: He is running the government that is responding to the worst pandemic in a century at the same time he is the leader of the resistance to his own government, urging people and states to open up whenever they see fit, recommending Clorox injections, stifling Dr. Fauci, refusing to wear the mask.","1614894897","6"
"3203","The fact is that Donald Trump has been wearing a mask for a long time, like Eleanor Rigby “wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door.” He studied larger-than-life titans like George Steinbrenner and Lee Iacocca and invented a swaggering character called Donald Trump with a career marked by evasions, deceptions and disguises.","1614894897","6"
"3204","“He is the most vaudevillian performance artist who ever inhabited the White House,” says his biographer Tim O’Brien. “He has a consuming desire to always be center stage, yet he never wants to reveal who he really is. He masks his finances, his taxes, his friendships, his ongoing family conflicts of interest, his ignorance and his inadequacies. He’s constantly making up areas of expertise he doesn’t have.","1614894897","6"
"3205","Those of us who have donned protective masks to fight the virus have taken off our professional masks — makeup, fashion, artifice. Now we see celebrities and journalists in their own habitats without hair and makeup, and that has made them seem more fully human.","1614894897","6"

First in line was Joan Laughlin, a nurse who has been coming to the museum since moving to Houston in 1970. She was here to see “Glory of Spain,” an exhibition of works from New York’s Hispanic Society Museum and Library.","1614958629","6"
"3210","Gov. Greg Abbott allowed museums in Texas to reopen on May 1 at 25 percent capacity, but most cultural institutions in the state have opted to wait. Among the first to come back was the Museum of Fine Arts’ neighbor, the Houston Museum of Natural Science, which opened its doors on May 15. The museum’s many interactive exhibits were turned off, and visitors were required to wear masks, but its president and CEO, Joel Bartsch, said the museum had no problem filling its quota of 1,000 daily visitors.","1614958629","6"
"3211","“I was pleasantly surprised,” Mr. Bartsch said. “We had a very good turnout, and everyone kept their distance. Not one person complained about having to wear a mask.” Other Texas museums opening soon include the Holocaust Museum Houston (May 26), the San Antonio Museum of Art (May 28) and the Witte Museum in San Antonio (May 30).","1614958629","6"
"3212","Mr. Tinterow was on hand at the science museum to observe opening day. “I saw that all the visitors were behaving, and that people were excited and relieved,” he said during a recent interview in his office, where he wore a pinstripe gray mask that recalled an Agnes Martin painting. “That gave me confidence that if they could do it, we could do it.”","1614958629","6"
"3213","Procuring safety supplies and equipment fell to Andrew Spies, the fine arts museum’s head of housekeeping. Mr. Spies sourced hand sanitizer from a lubricant manufacturer in North Carolina, which shipped it to Houston in 250-pound drums; 10,000 disposable masks from a warehouse in McAllen, Texas; a dozen thermal imaging devices from Feevr; and disinfecting solution from the germ-fighting experts at the Children’s Museum of Houston.","1614958629","6"

Anyone who enters the building will be required to wear a mask, follow social-distancing rules, undergo temperature checks and abstain from using public transit.

"3217","The debate over whether Americans should wear face masks to control coronavirus transmission has been settled. Governments and businesses now require or at least recommend them in many public settings. But as parts of the country reopen, some doctors want you to consider another layer of personal protective equipment in your daily life: clear plastic face shields.","1615426918","6"
"3218","“I wear a face shield every time I enter a store or other building,” said Dr. Eli Perencevich. “Sometimes I also wear a cloth mask if required by the store’s policy.”","1615426918","6"
"3219","But it can be difficult to imagine Americans being willing to put on another form of protective equipment. President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have shirked wearing masks in settings that would seem to call for them, and simple face covering requirements have provoked conflicts at grocery stores and restaurants.","1615426918","6"
"3220","Surgical masks and N95s, on the other hand, are meant to be disposed after each use, although some studies have shown masks can be reused two or three times after being sterilized before they lose integrity.","1615426918","6"
"3221","Face shields may be easier to wear than masks, he said, comparing them with wearing glasses or a hat. They wrap around a small portion of a person’s forehead rather than covering more than half their face with material that can create the urge to itch.","1615426918","6"
"3222","Many people also wear masks incorrectly, letting them dangle off the tips of their noses, or concealing just their mouths. People also tend to readjust face masks frequently, or remove them to communicate with others, which increases their risk of being exposed or infecting others, he said. And while cloth masks can prevent people from spreading germs to others, they don’t usually protect the wearer from infection.","1615426918","6"
"3223","Just like masks, they must be removed when eating in cafeterias or restaurants. And studies on how effectively they can reduce a person’s viral exposure are scarce.","1615426918","6"
"3224","Even in close range, there can be scenarios where face shields are not as effective as masks like N95s that create a seal around one’s face. “If you’re facing sideways, or I’m behind you, maybe you’re sitting at a desk and I’m standing, there’s other scenarios you can imagine where droplets can come around a face shield,” Dr. Lindsley said.","1615426918","6"
"3225","There is also no research on how well one person’s face shield protects other people from viral transmission, the concept called source control that is a primary benefit of surgical and cloth masks.","1615426918","6"
"3226","“I’m a huge fan of face shields,” said Saskia Popescu, a senior infection-prevention specialist at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. “But I don’t think we can swap them out for face masks just yet.”","1615426918","6"
"3227","Dr. Perencevich and his colleagues expect that more research will show shields to be superior to cloth masks, not only because shields provide full face protection but as they are nearly impossible to wear incorrectly.","1615426918","6"
"3228","And he and his co-authors like to imagine that people who are reluctant to wear masks will find face shields more comfortable: Once a person tries one on, they say, the wearer realizes its many benefits.","1615426918","6"
"3229","Millions of Americans now routinely wear masks when we go outdoors, a group effort that was inconceivable just weeks ago. Today, nearly two-thirds of Americans agree that masking is a matter of public health. (The science, while still evolving, backs that up.)","1615426908","6"
"3230","We also know that our own decisions, as individuals, will be vital in helping to protect our neighbors. Until there is a vaccine, which could be years from now, the simple acts of wearing a mask and practicing social distancing may be the most reliable ways to stem the spread of the disease and save more lives.","1615426908","6"

"3284","In New York City, Mr. Romano was not the only man charged on Tuesday. Federal authorities also accused Richard Schirripa, a pharmacist who once owned a drugstore on Madison Avenue, of selling thousands of N95 masks to doctors and funeral directors at a 50 percent markup, often out of the trunk of his car. “This stuff is like gold right now,” a criminal complaint quoted Mr. Schirripa saying to an undercover agent.","1617362738","6"
"3285","The investigation started last month after 3M filed a federal lawsuit against Mr. Romano’s company, Performance Supply LLC, accusing it, among other things, of falsely claiming to be an authorized distributor of the highly sought-after 3M masks.","1617362738","6"
"3286","Mr. Tashkovich was involved in discussions with Mr. Romano about selling masks to the city, documents and the people familiar with the case say.","1617362738","6"
"3287","Mr. Jacques, who did not return telephones calls from a reporter, also contacted the city during the negotiations over the mask deal, documents show. On March 24, according to the emails, Mr. Jacques wrote to the same city procurement official that Mr. Romano had contacted when he falsely claimed to be a authorized dealer.","1617362738","6"
"3288","A person who based on the details provided is Mr. Campanella sought to obtain masks from several sources and helped Mr. Romano create a document on the letterhead of one of Mr. Campanella’s companies, falsely claiming Performance Supply was authorized to sell 3M products, the complaint said.","1617362738","6"
"3289","Mr. Campanella denied any role in the procurement deal on Monday, saying he had only put Mr. Romano in touch with a hedge fund that had masks. “I did not make any offerings or any documentation to offer anything to New York City,” he said. He did not respond to telephone messages on Tuesday after the criminal complaint was made public.","1617362738","6"
"3290","Mr. Pichardo said it was not until May — two months after the pandemic shut down the city — that he received more than 4,000 masks from the mayor’s office, and 300 bottles of hand sanitizer from the governor’s office, for his district, which includes Morris Heights.","1617379667","6"

"3293","The Morris Heights Health Center set up its own temporary testing sites in April. Nearly a third of the more than 1,000 people tested were positive. “We made every attempt to get ahead of it as quickly as possible,” said Mari G.

"3299","Joseph R. Biden Jr. laced into President Trump on Tuesday, calling him an “absolute fool” for refusing to wear a mask in public on Memorial Day and for appearing to scoff at the former vice president for wearing one.","1617443632","6"
"3300","“He’s a fool, an absolute fool to talk that way,” Mr. Biden said in an interview with Dana Bash of CNN, his first in-person interview since the coronavirus crisis took him off the campaign trail. Castigating Mr. Trump for “this macho stuff,” Mr. Biden accused him of “stoking deaths” and aggravating cultural divisions over mask-wearing.","1617443632","6"
"3301","The interview, conducted outside Mr. Biden’s home in Wilmington, Del., and with Mr. Biden and Ms. Bash seated 12 feet apart, occurred a day after he appeared in public for the first time in more than two months, visiting a veterans memorial in Delaware. He and his wife, Jill Biden, both wore black masks as they laid a wreath, cutting a stark visual contrast with Mr. Trump, who has largely declined to wear a mask in public despite federal health recommendations.","1617443632","6"
"3302","Mr. Biden’s rebuke of Mr. Trump was yet another sign that he views the president’s refusal to wear a mask as a vulnerability that makes him appear reckless, while Mr. Biden presents himself as a sober-minded leader. Appearing to put an even finer point on his argument, Mr. Biden on Tuesday evening changed his Twitter avatar to an image of him wearing a mask.","1617443632","6"

"3304","When The Times and Siena College surveyed people in the New York area about when they might feel comfortable attending live events like concerts, plays and ballgames again, a majority said that they would probably wait until 2021. The No. 1 reason for hesitating: They did not trust that everyone in the audience would obey the rules, wear masks and keep a safe distance away.","1617461017","6"
"3305","Share safely. Give food to friends and family while reducing your risk of transmitting or getting the virus. Here’s one way: When delivering, wear a mask, place the food six feet from the door, and then back away so those inside can retrieve it.","1617461017","6"
"3306","Here’s another striking comparison: Close to 99 percent of Hong Kong residents have been wearing masks, to prevent the wearer from spreading the virus, since early February. According to a mid-April Gallup poll, only a third of Americans say they always wear a mask or cloth face covering outside the home. Another third of us sometimes wear a mask in public, and a third never do.","1617794483","6"
"3307","Universal face mask adoption isn’t the only difference between Hong Kong and the United States, and it’s not a substitute for physical-distancing, hand-washing and other preventive practices. But masks — even just a scarf, bandanna or an old T-shirt and two rubber bands — are widely viewed as critical to stopping the transmission of the novel coronavirus.","1617794483","6"
"3308","Nevertheless, face-mask compliance on this side of the Pacific has been uneven. This is especially worrisome in closed, crowded spaces like subways and buses, grocery stores and offices where it’s not easy to maintain a distance of six feet from other people and avoid spontaneous coughs and sneezes.","1617794483","6"
"3309","The most obvious path to universal masking is to pass laws and punish infractions. But enforcing legal edicts to wear masks in public can be difficult and costly, and amid widespread ambivalence can lead to backlash and even violence. So edicts are not a complete solution.","1617794483","6"
"3310","As experts in public health and human behavior, we propose a complementary approach: Make wearing a mask easy, understood and expected.","1617794483","6"
"3311","From effortful to easy: Where can you get face masks? You can search for them online, you can now buy them in drugstores and yes, you can make them yourself. But none of these options are effortless.","1617794483","6"
"3312","Imagine if every city and town in this country had an Adrian Cheng, the real estate developer in Hong Kong who had a manufacturing line set up in one of his empty properties and made the masks available free to the needy in vending machines devised specifically for the purpose. Not long after, the Hong Kong government set up a website where any household can register to have reusable masks delivered free. Or consider Utah, where residents can likewise register online and receive a free fabric face mask by mail. The cheaper and more ubiquitous face masks are, the easier it will be for Americans to get our hands on them, and the more likely we’ll do so and wear them.","1617794483","6"
"3313","From unclear to understood: Not long ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the surgeon general were lecturing the American public on why they shouldn’t wear face masks. That recommendation flipped once it became clear that people infected with the coronavirus can spread it before they know they have it and, therefore, everyone should wear a mask to reduce the chances of infecting others. Since it’s hard for people to update their beliefs once a message has been received, it’s no surprise that misinformation and outdated news continue to ricochet in the echo chambers of social media.","1617794483","6"
"3314","Unfortunately, it is often easier to dig our heels in than to change our minds, defending our original position and discounting new information to justify our behavior. Therefore, it can be helpful to supply people with a rationale to change their behavior without looking like a hypocrite. For example, officials can emphasize that at the start of this crisis, nobody could have known how important it is to wear a mask when you have no symptoms, and that day by day, new scientific evidence is demonstrating the efficacy of masks in the fight against the coronavirus.","1617794483","6"
"3315","How do we create a social norm of mask-wearing when, in fact, so many Americans are doing exactly the opposite? One common mistake is drawing attention to the lack of compliance. For instance, highlighting littering as a commonplace problem can inadvertently lead to more littering because it strengthens the perception that littering is the norm. Instead, in press releases and public service announcements, officials should emphasize that the clear trend in this country is toward universal mask-wearing.","1617794483","6"
"3316","According to a recent Qualtrics study, a majority of surveyed Americans now say they won’t return to the office unless their company makes wearing face masks mandatory. And in just one week in April, the percentage of Americans who said they wore a mask outside the home increased by more than half.","1617794483","6"
"3317","Norms are also established by high-status role models. Celebrities and professional athletes can do their part by posting photos about wearing face masks in public. And to counter the politicized nature of the issue, let’s all applaud mask-wearing leaders on both the right and the left. Hurrah for Melania Trump posting a photo of herself in a mask, and hurrah, too, for Nancy Pelosi wearing a scarf on the House floor.","1617794483","6"
"3318","The story of face masks in this country is still being written. We may lack the wisdom Hong Kong earned weathering prior epidemics, but it’s not too late to apply three basic principles from behavioral science: make it easy, understood and expected, and we’ll soon see face masks everywhere, saving lives.","1617794483","6"
"3319","If someone you have been isolating with can drop you in their own car, that raises the least possible risk. If you need to take a car service like Uber or Lyft, you should remember that those companies are not allowing ride shares (so you can expect to pay more for your ride) and it’s courteous to drivers and passengers who come after you to wipe down the seat and door handle before exiting the car. Uber and Lyft are requiring that all passengers and drivers wear masks. The companies said they are also providing cleaning supplies to as many drivers as possible.","1617794475","6"
"3320","Flying has always been a high-touch exercise so think about all those points and how you can minimize them. Wrapping yourself head to toe in plastic wrap is not really necessary, but you should carry — and use — a mask, wipes and hand sanitizer. Some experts suggest wearing gloves, though the Centers for Disease Control’s guidance suggests they are not necessary.","1617794475","6"
"3321","Other airports have increased hand sanitizer stations throughout the airport as well as the regularity with which they are cleaning; in some cases it’s hourly. Many are also requiring all passengers to wear masks.","1617794475","6"
"3322","That’s where your at-home prep comes in. Do as much of the process on your airline’s app as you can. Bring hand sanitizer in case you need to hand over documents or your phone, or if you need to key anything in at a kiosk. Pay attention to the floor markers indicating the proper social distancing. Even though crowds have been thin, maintaining social distancing may be difficult, so wear your mask. Expect T.S.A. agents to be wearing them as well.","1617794475","6"

"3324","Even among the surreal sights of an intensive care unit crowded with Covid-19 patients, Dr. Elaine Fajardo’s mask stands out.","1617794465","6"
"3325","In the past, Dr. Fajardo, like most health care workers, relied on disposable N95 masks, which are in critically short supply globally because of the coronavirus pandemic. Now she is the beneficiary of a prescient decision: As the virus raged in China, Yale hospital administrators bought about 1,200 of the reusable silicone masks, known as elastomeric respirators, and gave them to doctors, nurses and respiratory therapists starting in March.","1617794465","6"
"3326","Government-supported research predicted over a decade ago that a pandemic would cause a dire shortage of disposable masks, and multiple federal agencies urged hospitals and policymakers to consider stockpiling elastomerics, which are designed to be cleaned and reused for years and are government-certified to protect at least as well as N95s. Last year, researchers simulating a pandemic found that health care workers could be rapidly fitted and trained to use the masks, and last month the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published guidance on deploying them in response to the coronavirus.","1617794465","6"
"3327","But only a handful of U.S. hospitals are using the masks widely, and the federal government — including the agency that manages the Strategic National Stockpile — has made no effort to boost production or facilitate their distribution, an examination by The New York Times found. At the same time, the shortage of disposable N95s is so severe that federal regulators have taken the extraordinary step of allowing them to be used multiple times with little-tested decontamination methods.","1617794465","6"
"3328","The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it “is not actively seeking out procurement” of elastomerics. The Department of Health and Human Services said the stockpile it manages “has not received any requests for elastomeric respirators and does not hold them in inventory.” When asked why the masks were not being deployed despite the studies and previous government guidance, each agency referred The Times to the other.","1617794465","6"
"3329","Elastomerics pose practical challenges, including fitting and cleaning, but the primary obstacles to wider adoption have been cultural and economic: concern about the masks’ industrial appearance and reluctance to consider alternatives when N95s were cheap and abundant.","1617794465","6"
"3330","Administrators said they suspected many other medical centers didn’t know about elastomerics. “I do think that part of this is around education,” said Dr. Sri Chalikonda, chief medical operations officer for Allegheny Health Network, which is using the masks at multiple hospitals near Pittsburgh. “It wasn’t that it was an option that was turned down. It was an option that probably wasn’t given.”","1617794465","6"
"3331","The panel found elastomerics effective and viable both for routine use and during a crisis. But there were practical hurdles, including the need for standardized guidance on wearing and cleaning the masks.","1617794465","6"
"3332","They found their answer from MSA Safety, a Pennsylvania-based company that makes safety gear — including elastomerics — for construction and industrial workers. Dr. Chalikonda, a surgeon charged with overseeing parts of the supply chain for the network’s hospitals, dug into the research on the reusable masks.","1617794465","6"
"3333","The rubbery masks can muffle workers’ speech, but nurses and doctors said they had devised easy workarounds, such as writing on white boards. In interviews, several said elastomerics were more comfortable than N95s and they felt better protected — a perception supported by C.D.C. research.","1617794465","6"
"3334","Past concerns about the masks’ industrial appearance are now largely moot, as many patients are sedated, tethered to unfamiliar machines and surrounded by workers outfitted with an array of other protective gear. Aside from the occasional cultural reference — Darth Vader, Predator, the meth-cooking leads in “Breaking Bad” — patients rarely mention the masks, the health workers said.","1617794465","6"
"3335","Government-backed studies have demonstrated effective techniques for cleaning and disinfecting the masks, and the C.D.C. offered guidance in April. At the four medical centers whose employees spoke with The Times, similar systems are in place. Workers use disinfecting wipes on them periodically — which takes just minutes — and at the end of a shift, most send their masks for cleaning at sterile processing facilities.","1617794465","6"
"3336","Some front-line workers using elastomerics said they were likely to return to N95s after the pandemic, but others said they planned to continue using the new masks.","1617794465","6"
"3337","“I think I will always hold on to and cherish my elastomeric,” said Dr. Levine of the University of Maryland Medical Center. She envisions a day when she is meeting with medical students in her office and they see the unusual mask.","1617794465","6"

"3339","As one of the most corrupt cops in the history of television, Vic Mackey did only what was good for Vic Mackey, wetting his beak all over Los Angeles and brutalizing (or arresting, or both) whoever got in his way.

"3340","But the national government has also said that any sharp rise in new infections would prompt another lockdown, and the mayor of one small town in the southern region of Puglia closed the beaches this week after seeing an “invasion” of sunbathers, many, he said, “wearing their masks as necklaces.”","1618096338","6"
"3341","Instead, Mr. Trinchillo, who is also the vice president of Italy’s union of beach club presidents, opted for more traditional arrangements, with more room between the umbrellas and lounge chairs.

"3342","Campania’s measures were adopted at midnight last Friday, when Vincenzo De Luca, the governor, perhaps best known during the coronavirus outbreak for threatening to take a “blowtorch” to illegal gatherings and for calling his citizens “doubly imbeciles” for bothering to wear masks but then letting them hang around their necks, decided that infections had gone down enough for beach clubs to open. The region also allowed bathers to remove their masks on the beach, as long as they observed social-distancing measures.","1618096338","6"

"3344","Mr. Trinchillo agreed that “everyone is a little chubbier” and said through a mask that he was delighted to finally see people back in the beach chairs. To observe social-distancing measures, he had to reduce his beach-chair capacity to 1,200 from 2,000.

"3348","Walt Disney World, one of the largest tourist sites on the planet, has a plan to reopen in mid-July. But the necessary safety protocols — limiting the number of visitors, making face masks mandatory, deploying roaming squads to enforce social distancing, no longer allowing people to get up close and personal with Mickey Mouse — shows how difficult it will be to operate once-booming attractions as the country prepares for a broader reopening.","1618255225","6"
"3349","The Orange County Recovery Task Force in Orlando approved reopening plans for Disney World and SeaWorld on Wednesday but pressed executives about how they would enforce mask wearing, something that has become a contentious issue as more people return to public places and may pose difficulties for vacationers in the Florida heat. Jim MacPhee, Disney’s World’s senior vice president for operations, said signs would have “strong language” and that “high-energy squads” of employees would remind guests about compliance. He said Disney might establish “relaxation zones” where guests can take off their masks.","1618255225","6"
"3350","Disney did not give reopening dates for the smallest of its six Florida parks, Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach, which offer water slides. Disney Vacation Club, a time-share business with 3,200 units at the resort, will reopen on June 22.

He told me about his haircut. “My barber was wearing a mask and a face shield,” he said. “It was really weird, but I felt so good.” He lost his job as a copywriter last month. I exhaled and told him about cutting my own hair with the scissors on a Swiss Army knife, a habit I’d picked up years before while traveling on my bicycle. It felt good to laugh and think about other places. I didn’t have to make eye contact or worry about what I looked like.","1618415190","6"
"3354","Our call also ended unexpectedly, this time after 43 minutes — maybe an internet problem. We were talking about showering, orthodontics and going to the grocery store in a mask. I could hear her washing dishes. I was folding laundry. We had no way to call each other back.","1618415190","6"
"3355","Nonetheless, Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, has said that because Northern Virginia health officials judged that the region had met four of the six metrics for reopening, the area would begin to do so on Friday, joining the less-affected parts of the commonwealth. That day, Virginia will also begin a statewide mask requirement for indoor businesses. ","1618430630","6"
"3356","But it’s sort of hard to focus on the supporting cast when the big boss has been so off-the-wall.

Sometimes rural people interpret the mask not as a sign of caution and concern but as a sign of active infection. Some of the most conservative people I know are the most enthusiastic about masks, it turns out, and some of the most liberal express doubts about how medically useful a handmade mask really is. “Would you buy a colostomy bag from Etsy?” one friend asked in a private message.","1622085616","6"

I find it so sad to think that there are people who maybe are not wearing them simply because they do not know how to get them, can’t afford them or maybe really do not know they need to. It is these among us who I believe most deserve our mercy and our love.”","1622085616","6"

One day while we were changing shifts at the center, there were five of us in the kitchen — more than there should have been. We were talking about child rearing. I think we were tired, and tired of being careful, and we were all laughing, the kind of laughing that is a release, the kind that you don’t want to let go of. Then someone who had come to drop off masks walked in. She said, ‘I am sorry. I just had to come inside. I heard you from the parking lot, and it has been so long since I heard laughter. I needed to come inside.’”","1622085616","6"

"3531","“I have been in rural Virginia doing building maintenance on my mom’s farm. There seem to be two main sets of extremely angry people here — those who wear masks, are terrified of the virus, and want outsiders, even property owners, to stay away. Then there are the rabid anti-maskers, with an attitude of ‘Don’t tread on me, this is all being blown out of proportion, I’m not scared of the virus and I’ll fight anyone who makes me wear a mask.’ As a mask-wearing nonresident, it’s been nerve-racking.”","1622085616","6"

I gestured to him to wait for a minute since I was almost done. His response was extreme fury. Gesticulating, he reminded me of how many people die every day from flu and car accidents. I told him that it was for him as much as it was for myself that I was asking him to wait. Then I walked out of the aisle from the other side without picking up what I needed.”","1622085616","6"

It was my first experience seeing employees wiping down carts and counting heads. Everyone in the store was wearing a mask. I anticipated a copacetic crowd there. What I didn’t expect was to break down crying beside the avocados. The reality of being in a mask-wearing crowd, the validation of the need for masks, being accepted with like-minded shoppers were a relief and a terror to me. Evidently the reality had elbow room to move around inside me when I let down my defenses.”","1622085616","6"

"3569","It is the pandemic’s defining symbol, a visual stand-in for the coronavirus itself. In America, the medical mask used to be confined to hospital dramas and operating rooms, but now the bare face is what registers as a choice. The mask is a public health device, but it has also revealed itself as a mask in the more traditional sense: a tool in a social ritual, a fetish object that signifies a person’s politics, gender expression and relationship to truth itself.","1623492909","6"
"3570","To its supporters, mask-wearing is a visual expression of civic duty, an affirmation of scientific authority and a show of respect. To its critics, it is a sign of weakness, emasculation and deceit. Most Americans accept the medical benefits of masks, but the ones who do not are, more often than not, Republican and male. Their rhetoric dovetails with racist ideas about Asian cultures, where wearing a mask in public has long been normalized. And it improvises on decades of work on the right to stitch the words “effete” and “liberal” together, painting a whole swath of the political spectrum as a feminine affectation.","1623492909","6"
"3571","Among their ranks is R.R. Reno, the editor of the conservative religious journal First Things (“Masks = enforced cowardice,” he wrote in a Twitter rant about the mask “regime”), and Donald Trump. (“Somehow, I don’t see it for myself,” he said, even as he announced the C.D.C. guideline urging people to wear masks in public.) Last month, as a maskless Trump toured an Arizona mask factory, his supporters heckled the masked reporter BrieAnna J. Frank outside. “It’s submission, it’s muzzling yourself, it looks weak — especially for men,” one man told her.","1623492909","6"
"3572","To these men, masking signals not just cowardice but hypocrisy. Mask-wearers stand accused of cowering in fear, but also of cynically exaggerating the virus’s threat. The mask is cast as both a defensive shield and an accessory in a masquerade of political correctness. A recent email from the Trump campaign called Joe Biden a “basement dweller and virtue signaler,” and accused him of colluding with “the media mask-shamers” to deceive the public by only covering up when the cameras were rolling.","1623492909","6"
"3573","The implication is that people who choose to wear masks aren’t just protecting themselves — they’re attacking the president and his supporters. Recently a sign appeared on the door of a Texas restaurant banning masks: “Due to our concern for our customers, if they FEEL (not think), that they need to wear a mask, they should stay home until they FEEL that it’s safe to be in public without one,” it read.","1623492909","6"
"3574","Even for those who believe in its health benefits, the mask has a symbolic role, and these two functions are related. The facts of transmission — masks are most effective when worn by infected people, many of whom have little to no symptoms — have required building a moral justification for otherwise healthy people to don them. The mask “signifies strength and compassion for others,” Roy Cooper, the Democratic governor of North Carolina, tweeted recently. Meanwhile, mask defenders suggest that those who refuse the mask are deceiving only themselves. A study of American attitudes toward masks found that men are less likely to believe they will be “seriously affected by the coronavirus,” though the opposite is true. “This macho stuff,” Biden said after Trump retweeted a jab at the candidate’s own mask. “It’s cost people’s lives.”","1623492909","6"
"3575","These battle lines were drawn long before modern medicine articulated a justification for the mask. The medical anthropologist Christos Lynteris, who has traced the cultural role of “plague masks” in previous pandemics, notes that early protective equipment was also conflated with fear and cowardice. The plague doctor costume, which featured a grotesque beak stuffed with aromatic herbs designed to ward off “bad air” from plague sufferers, was accused of stoking terror. “The imagination merely frightened by the plague is enough to bring on the disease,” wrote Geronimo Gastaldi, an Italian health official during Rome’s 1656 outbreak.","1623492909","6"
"3576","Trump, too, seems less than willing to fight the coronavirus rationally, instead claiming it will disappear “like a miracle.” It is as if taking the disease seriously is an indictment of his presidency. By dismissing the threat and banishing its visual cues, Trump also shields his own reputation and protects his personal vanity. Inside the mask factory, when Trump wore protective goggles but no mask, he used the logic of the superhero mask — the ones that cover the eyes but reveal the mouth, a way of obscuring identity but accentuating rhetorical power. And few leaders use the mouth as acrobatically as Trump, whose expressions shift among the open-mouthed scream, the sarcastically jutted jaw, and the exaggerated, pinched pout.","1623492909","6"
"3577","In recent days, as protesters poured into the streets to protest the killing of George Floyd, the mask has taken on a new association. Wearing a mask to a protest used to signal that you were an anti-fascist or a cop suited up in anti-riot armor. But at these demonstrations, masks are ubiquitous, symbolizing civic action in more ways than one: Even as they protect the community from the virus, they protest the surveillance of the police.","1623492909","6"
"3578","No, Trump does not wear a mask. But as protesters have assembled in front of the White House in recent days, he has descended into an underground bunker and turned out the lights. He has tweeted about the Secret Service protecting him from the American people with “the most vicious dogs, most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” The police have buzzed D.C. demonstrators with helicopters and fired on them with rubber bullets. The notion that these masked protesters could represent cowardice, and Trump strength, is absurd. “We are here to show that regardless of what is happening to our health we refuse to run,” one protester told The Cut. “We refuse to live in fear.”","1623492909","6"
"3579","As states continue to lift restrictions that were put in place to curb the coronavirus outbreak and as Americans start going out in public again, recent surveys suggest that gender, political affiliation and education level are factors that have a bearing on who is wearing a mask, and who isn’t.","1623518302","6"
"3580","Public health officials have recommended wearing masks in public when social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as in grocery stores and pharmacies, and at least a dozen states have required them in those circumstances.

"3624","The mask should be a medical signal, not a political one. But Trump rejects the mask because of a misbegotten image of masculinity and power.

By then, masks were sold out in most Japanese drugstores, but the Tokyo bureau of The Times managed to procure a small supply that we had to ration.","1627624718","6"

"3855","With paper masks sold out everywhere, the Japanese government sent cloth masks in the mail in April. The initiative, which cost about $400 million, became the butt of jokes, when people discovered the masks were too small to cover most adults’ mouths and noses. ","1627624718","6"
"3856","The masks became a symbol of failings in the government’s coronavirus response. In the early months of the pandemic, Japan seemed not to follow much of the conventional epidemiological wisdom, deliberately restricting testing and not ordering a lockdown.","1627624718","6"

"3859","Japan’s experience with masks goes back hundreds of years. Mining workers started using them during the Edo period, between the 17th and 19th centuries, to prevent inhalation of dust. The masks were often made from the pulp of plums, said Kazunari Onishi, author of “The Dignity of Masks” and an associate professor at St. Luke’s International University in Tokyo.","1627624718","6"
"3860","Dr. Onishi said that early in the 20th century, the Japanese viewed masks as unattractive, but were persuaded to wear them during the 1918 flu pandemic.

"3863","The scientific evidence on whether a mask protects the wearer from infection is mixed. But experiments show that masks can be effective in blocking the emission of respiratory droplets that may contain the virus, even when someone has no symptoms of illness.

We don’t know the level of exposure required to make you sick, but estimates range from a few hundred to 1,000 copies of the virus. In theory, you might reach the higher estimate after just five minutes of close conversation, given that a person might expel 200 viral particles a minute through speech. When health officials perform contact tracing, they typically look for people with whom you’ve spent at least 15 minutes in close contact.","1629816942","6"

The researchers have also studied the effects of wearing a plastic face shield, he said. A boy’s choir in Austria had started to rehearse wearing those, he added, but in his team’s experiments, the aerosols simply hit the shield, then spread out around it and into the room. “They’re meaningless,” he said. “Unfortunately.”","1629990897","6"

"3975","Mr. Potter said he and his client had to confer so frequently that it was impractical to don masks, so they ended up getting much closer than health experts recommend. And there were other issues: Because the jury box could accommodate only three people, the rest of the jury was spread out behind Mr. Potter, where he could not see their reactions or be certain that they could see and hear the proceedings.","1630843596","6"

"3987","“Wearing a mask is so liberating I might hang on to it, even if they do find a Covid-19 cure,” said Clare Mackintosh, an author who lives in Wales. “I walked past a building site the other day, and despite my resting bitch face, no one yelled at me to ‘smile, love.’ No random men in the supermarket have suggested I ‘cheer up, it might never happen,’ and not a single person has suggested I’d look prettier with a grin on my face.”","1631110783","6"
"3988","Studies have found that people are less likely to find friendly looking faces guilty of crimes, while people who look “happy” are generally deemed more trustworthy. There is all sorts of research about the subtle — and sometimes not subtle at all — race and gender biases wrapped into how we view another’s facial expressions (or, in some cases, our inability to see them), with people of color often paying the highest price. In the pandemic, black men have expressed worry that facial masks will invite racial profiling by police.","1631110783","6"

I couldn’t smile at dogs, or children, or the protesters marching down my street (a raised fist felt more fitting anyway).

"3994","“I am definitely aware that I am way more expressive with my voice when I’m wearing a mask,” said Amy Zhang, a producer in Brooklyn who grew in Hong Kong during the SARS era, when masks were commonplace. “But it is a weird thing, at a time where we’re all going through such trauma and grief, to not be able to express a smile.”","1631110783","6"
"3995","As Dr. LaFrance described it, it is the social, obligatory smile — “which is the one that women do the most,” she said — that tends to be focused on the mouth muscles, easily covered up by a medical mask. But a genuine smile, or what is know in the field as the Duchenne smile (named for Guillaume Duchenne), a French anatomist who discovered it, involves both the mouth and the eyes.","1631110783","6"

"3999","This is something we’ve had to grapple with in our house. My son Teddy is fiercely protective of Jo Jo and grills me when I return from grocery shopping to make sure I wore a mask and washed my hands.

His social media feed is filled with classmates attending barbecues and not-socially-distanced sleepovers.","1631110780","6"
"4000","The public health establishment makes a mistake in suggesting that a mask should be worn not to protect the wearer but to protect others. Immediately this provokes two responses — first, I’m not sick, so I don’t need to wear a mask, and second, I don’t care about others.","1631241679","6"
"4001","A plain old fabric mask may not provide as much protection as an N95, but I understand that depending on the type of fabric, it will stop as much as 70 percent of virus-size particles. Certainly that qualifies as “protection.” And fabric masks obviously protect the wearer from inbound globs of snot or saliva that might come from other people sneezing, coughing, singing or shouting.","1631241679","6"

So please, in the name of our humanity and our hearts, ask them to use transparent plastic face shields instead of masks.","1631241679","6"

"4014","On any given day, any corner, any group of officers, some or all of them are not wearing masks. Others wear them below their chin.

"4016","While police officers may forgo mask-wearing for any number of reasons, from peer pressure within ranks that are loath to change to a desire to more easily communicate, the images have fueled a perception of the police as arrogant and dismissive of protesters’ health — perhaps even at the peril of their own.","1631732666","6"
"4017","And while several officers have conspicuously knelt down with or hugged people at rallies, the widespread failure to use masks is creating a more standoffish look, one that protesters say suggests that the police operate above the rules — one of the very beliefs motivating the nationwide movement.","1631732666","6"
"4018","The official New York Police Department policy is that officers should wear masks when interacting with the public. But in a statement on Wednesday, the department dismissed the criticism about the lack of masks as petty.","1631732666","6"

"4020","Then the protests began, putting the officers, working in large crowds, in the spotlight. The new questions arise during what seems, from the outside, to have been an evolving relationship between officers and protective masks.

"4023","“The time to use a mask is when someone is symptomatic, when they’re coughing, when they’re sneezing, and it’s to ensure that that individual doesn’t contaminate other folks,” she said. “It gives people who are asymptomatic a false sense of security that if they wear this mask, they don’t have to wash their hands, they don’t have to cover their mouths and their noses when they cough or their sneeze.”","1631732666","6"

"4067","On a recent walk, I found myself at Dante once again. The door was open, a board laid across it forming a makeshift table, and I ordered a coffee and a chocolate croissant to go. On the sound system was Buddy Guy followed by Elvis: music that made me want to dance on the sidewalk. Liana Oster, the bartender, sliced up a watermelon. “I’m thinking watermelon margaritas,” she said from behind the bar, her face half hidden by a mask embroidered with the Dante logo.

"4082","Children are more apt to practice social distancing if it also somehow feels fun.

"4083","The C.D.C. recommends that children over two wear a cloth face covering  in public, but getting them to keep the face covering on is hard. Borrow a page from Halloween and make them fun. Buy a cool superhero, cat, or dinosaur mask from Etsy. Or make one: YouTube has lots of how-to videos. It’s a craft project that protects your child and kills time during endless days at home. You might also consider bandannas and neck gaiters; they’re less fussy and easier for young ones to take on and off.","1633718257","6"
"4084","Debates about using rewards to motivate children are endless, but parents trade favors for obedience all the time. Even the C.D.C. signs off on rewarding good behavior (say, wearing a mask outside without fussing) with praise, a board game or an extra book at bedtime. For older children, a little money might help, at least in the short term, according to Emily Edlynn, a child psychologist and parenting columnist. And it’s really only bribery if you hand out the reward before the effort. Afterward? It’s reinforcement.","1633718257","6"

"4098","It was not the first time he has refused to don a mask since resuming a heavy travel schedule representing the administration at graduations, hospitals and factories across the country. But because he appeared to be defying rules put in place by one of the country’s most renowned medical facilities, it seemed to strike a nerve.","1648087733","6"
"4099","At the time, Mr. Pence explained that because he was tested regularly for the coronavirus, he was not at risk of contributing to asymptomatic spread and therefore did not need to wear a mask — an argument that experts immediately dismissed.","1648087733","6"

"4117","Even in its latest guidance, the W.H.O. made its reluctance abundantly clear, saying the usefulness of face masks is “not yet supported by high quality or direct scientific evidence,” but that governments should encourage mask wearing because of “a growing compendium of observational evidence.”","1651396884","6"

"4146","Not necessarily. When cities and states started urging people to wear masks to reduce transmission of the coronavirus, some made exceptions for exercising. Carry a mask, many seemed to say, but if you’re by yourself on an empty street, you don’t have to wear it.","1651547412","6"
"4147","New York City explicitly states that face coverings are not required while walking, running or biking, if you can keep your distance. Likewise, San Francisco has urged runners to carry a mask and put it on when they are within 30 feet of other people.","1651547412","6"
"4148","Since mid-May, Los Angeles has required residents to put on a face covering upon leaving home. But masks are not required while running and biking so long as distance is maintained — though they should be carried, the county and city later clarified.","1651547412","6"
"4149","It can be really hard to run in a mask.","1651547412","6"
"4150","Many runners are put off by how challenging it is to inhale as their heart rate rises. It can be much more difficult than walking in a mask.","1651547412","6"
"4151","Others forgo one because, even as the virus spreads, masks have not been widely adopted in their communities.","1651547412","6"
"4152","“Oh gosh no!” said Larry Holt, the owner of Ken Combs Running Store in Louisville, Ky., when asked if runners there wore masks. “That’s the craziest thing I’ve ever heard of in my life.”","1651547412","6"
"4153","(In Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear asked residents to begin wearing masks in public on May 11. Like officials elsewhere, he made an exception for people exercising alone.)","1651547412","6"
"4154","Even in Hong Kong, a city so committed to face coverings in public that it has been widely praised as a model, there is little expectation that runners will wear masks, said Brian Woo, a founder of a running group there. “I assume it’s just understood that running is not a time for wearing masks,” he said.","1651547412","6"
"4155","There is no scientific consensus around the importance of wearing a mask while exercising, primarily because so little relevant research has been completed. ","1651547412","6"
"4156","Researchers do agree that masks slow the spread of the virus. They also agree that it’s best to avoid exercising within six feet of anyone beyond your immediate household and that working out is less risky outside than inside.","1651547412","6"
"4157","Donald Milton, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland School of Public Health who has studied masks’ ability to block respiratory droplets, suggests their value depends on location. “Outdoors is relatively safe, and masks would only be important if you are exercising in crowded areas or indoors in space shared with other people,” he said.","1651547412","6"
"4158","Avoid popular routes and times, suggests Douglas Nicaragua, the owner of Go Run in Miami. He advises taking a mask, even if you don’t expect to cross paths with anyone. If you see someone, put it on. ","1651547412","6"
"4159","“Over time, you’ll get used to it,” said Joey Ta, a competitive endurance athlete in Los Angeles who recently started wearing a mask.","1651547412","6"
"4160","People exercising have used several kinds of masks, some with drawbacks. A surgical mask can easily grow damp and heavy with sweat; so can a cloth one. A bandanna tied around the head may slip more easily when running. Some may even consider a face shield.","1651547412","6"
"4161","And whether you wear a mask or not, pay attention to the position of people around you. Dr. Benjamin D. Levine, a professor of internal medicine at UT Southwestern Medical Center and Texas Health Presbyterian Dallas, is advising the U.S. track and field team on how to train safely.

"4186","Late last week, as she was leading the charge to push the Democrats’ $3 trillion pandemic relief package through the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi strode the floor of the Capitol in a fuchsia pantsuit, red pumps, white shell — and a coordinated red, white and green cherry-print face mask.","1693466149","6"
"4187","This was the day after Ms. Pelosi had stood at a podium for a news conference in a black dress with a complementary dark green and white foliage-print face mask — which was itself not long after she had appeared in a shell-pink pantsuit with a matching shell-pink mask.","1693466149","6"
"4188","Hillary Clinton took note, posting a photo on Instagram with the caption: “Leader of the House majority, and of mask-to-pantsuit color coordination.” The post has been liked more than 250,000 times.","1693466149","6"
"4189","Since late April, when she began wearing silk scarves that were color-coordinated with her suits and shells — orange and orange, blue and blue and cream and brown — and that she had worn bandanna-style around her face, Ms. Pelosi has also modeled a purple suit with a purple/blue, black and white geometric face mask and a white suit and blue shirt with the same.","1693466149","6"
"4190","And though it would be easy to categorize Ms. Pelosi’s masks as fun! and all about self-expression! and — yes — fashion!(as many style watchers have done), her track record and the way her approach contrasts with those around her suggest something more nuanced — though the stratagem is covered, natch, by the accessibility of patterned cloth, the kind we all have to wear and to which we can all relate.","1693466149","6"
"4191","After all, why simply don a face mask when you can also use it to make a political point?","1693466149","6"
"4192","Indeed, the sheer variety of her masks stands out like a beacon amid her sea of aides in generic white or blue medical masks and her dark-masked protective detail. It suggests a commitment to consciously choosing a mask every single day that, more than simply demonstrating good mask habits, civic awareness and solicitude for those around her, or even support for small businesses, demands attention. (Many of her masks come from Donna Lewis, a small store in Alexandria, Va., where she also buys some of her suits; for each mask sold, one is donated to Johns Hopkins hospitals.)","1693466149","6"
"4193","As the president continues to eschew the mask in his public appearances — over the weekend he went without one when meeting in the Rose Garden with Girl Scouts and small business leaders — Ms. Pelosi is making her mask-wearing, and the contrast with those around her, impossible to ignore. Doing so is a constant reminder of the difference between the heads of the executive and legislative branches.","1693466149","6"
"4194","Ms. Pelosi is not the first government official to match her masks to her outfit. That honor goes to the Slovakian president, Zuzana Caputova, whose image went viral in late March at the swearing in of her new coalition government when she wore a burgundy face mask that coordinated perfectly with her burgundy sheath dress. And, apparently, she instructed her new cabinet to wear identical masks (blue) and gloves (white) for the group photo, hence both distinguishing herself from the group and creating a perfectly harmonious picture of civic care.","1693466149","6"
"4195","Likewise, Emmanuel Macron donned a navy mask with a discreet red, white and blue grosgrain ribbon at the side to match his navy suit and little red, white and blue lapel pin on a visit to a school earlier this month.","1693466149","6"
"4196","Melania Trump, too, matched her basic white face mask to her basic white shirt when she appeared in her PSA for mask-wearing in early April. As did Ivanka Trump, who wore a black mask with a black jumpsuit to tour a Maryland produce distributor last week (though that mask had the effect of making her look unsettlingly like a movie bank robber, despite the little American flag pin on the side).","1693466149","6"
"4197","And though most of Congress has now been converted to mask-wearing, as the recent Senate hearings on Covid-19 revealed, with Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina modeling a University of North Carolina booster mask and Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, a red-and-black tie-dye bandanna. Still, they mostly seem to have resorted to the gimmick mask, the current equivalent of the gimmick tie (see also Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and his Washington Nationals mask), the patriot mask (Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina in a stars and stripes and eagles number) or the OK-I’ll-wear-it-if-I-have-to face mask that Vice President Mike Pence wore when he visited the General Motors and Ventec ventilator production plant in Indiana last month.","1693466149","6"

"4200","Casinos along the Strip last week reopened their doors to a flood of visitors, masked and unmasked but equally eager to test their luck after a 78-day hiatus. An over-the-top water show set to Elvis’s “Viva Las Vegas” at the Bellagio Hotel marked the occasion, and a marquee sign at the Aria Resort & Casino summed up Sin City’s new social distancing ethos: “Think dirty thoughts, but keep your hands clean.”","1693590001","6"

Steve Sisolak says he is confident that “every precaution possible” has been taken to ensure that the famed resorts can both serve guests and protect public health.

And neighborhood stores unlocked their doors and prepared to welcome customers.","1693780545","6"
"4203","Even as the city began reopening, there were reminders that the virus had not gone away. Office towers posted signs that anyone who entered must wear a mask. Companies held safety orientations for employees on how to avoid catching and spreading the illness.","1693780545","6"
"4204","Some construction workers sported blue wristbands that showed they had passed a virus check. At Hudson Yards, the city’s newest neighborhood on the Far West Side of Manhattan, a sign showed a construction worker in overalls, hard hat and face mask — with two thumbs up.","1693780545","6"

"4208","The asymptomatic may unwittingly pass on the disease before they sense illness. There is no security in having had a negative test for Covid-19. One may have contracted the virus at any time afterward. In ignoring mask and distancing guidance, one increases one’s own risk of becoming infected and then spreading the contagion.","1693800329","6"

"4222","Experts are increasingly suggesting that masks may need to be worn for at least a year, until a vaccine is developed.

"4223","The coronavirus is a crisis that respects no economic division. Everyone is a potential victim; everyone has been affected. The blue and white surgical masks that are currently the most visible personal protective equipment are democratizing forces, rendering all wearers equal under isolation, signifying our communal experience and our collective fear. Even the homemade masks that have begun to proliferate, while somewhat idiosyncratic, are united in their craftiness.","1695026708","6"
"4224","When masks migrate into the realm of fashion, however, they become something else. As with all accessories (as with shoes, bags and scarves), they become symbols of not just health or social concern, but of identity.","1695026708","6"
"4225","After all, with the lower face covered and, often, eyes shaded by sunglasses, the usual signposts of character are hidden. The mask becomes the first signifier of the individual. And that means it will also become a sign of aspiration, achievement — and inequality.","1695026708","6"
"4226","Masks, as a recent story in WWD posited, could even end up on the red carpet — in the form of a “couture mask.” Christian Siriano, one of the first designers to start making masks when Governor Cuomo asked for help, told the publication he has made “this fully encrusted pearl mask because I just needed a break.”","1695026708","6"
"4227","Maybe even President Trump, who has made something of a big deal out of his own reluctance to wear a mask, would don the accessory if it could be used, as he uses his ties and MAGA hats, to broadcast his own power.

"4228","(By contrast, the first lady, who has worn a basic white surgical mask in a PSA, seems to be using them as a symbol of public outreach.)","1695026708","6"
"4229","This kind of evolution is natural. It may be inevitable. It is the kind of human impulse fashion is built to serve. And it is occurring in markets in Tokyo and in Seoul, though not as much in Hong Kong, where the use of masks as a tool of protest and disguise still outweighs their use as a marker of personality.","1695026708","6"
"4230","Luxury brands may not be making masks now (just imagine the backlash), but it’s not too big a leap to believe there will come a time when they join the bandwagon, if simply because there is likely to be demand. Besides, they already have the expertise and capabilities.","1695026708","6"
"4231","In part this is why many brands have adopted a “buy one, give one” model, in which for every mask that is bought, they will give one to a worker on the front line (or in Collina Strada’s case, buy one for a lot of money in order to give five). Or they are donating a portion of each sale to a Covid-19-related charity.","1695026708","6"
"4232","This is also why some include explanations with the designs, couching them in civic-minded terms, like this one from MaskClub: “Founder Trevor George’s 8-month-old son was terrified to see him wear a mask, so he decided to make them with recognizable prints to make it less scary.”","1695026708","6"
"4233","It can seem like a Band-Aid for a guilty conscience. And maybe it is. Yet you can’t argue with the need for masks, or that many of the companies making them are doing so because there is little other option: No one is buying the clothes they make, and to create something — anything — for sale is to create a lifeline for employees and suppliers.","1695026708","6"
"4234","In that sense, every mask also represents labor and income at a time when both are in short supply. A sale can help buoy a small company. Perhaps it is time to let consumers know exactly how much.","1695026708","6"

Evers on Monday issued an executive order that bars in-person voting Tuesday and moves the state's spring election to June 9. It also calls lawmakers back into session this week to decide whether the election should be held at a different date. But the move is expected to immediately be challenged by Republican lawmakers who want to keep polls open and adjourned the Legislature on Monday without taking up measures to delay the election that Evers called for on Friday. … Evers’ order is likely the last move he can make to try to stop in-person voting Tuesday. In issuing the order, Evers is arguing he has the power to suspend voting even without legislative action, a position he has not previously held.”How did they screw things up? - FiveThirtyEight: “Well, it was harder for Wisconsin than other states because it is also holding general elections for several local offices — judges, mayors, county executives — including some whose terms begin on April 20 (so the election had to take place before then). In addition, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers probably did not have the power to alter the election without the consent of the Republican legislature, and that was always unlikely given the bad blood between the two. In fact, not only did Evers and the legislature not change the date of the election, but they have also been unable to agree on any statutory changes to the state’s election procedures in the face of restrictions on gatherings because of the coronavirus.”Coronavirus response sharply partisan in Wisconsin - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: “Assembly Republicans are calling on Gov. Tony Evers to allow in-person services for Easter and Passover amid the deadly coronavirus pandemic. ‘It is more important than ever that we allow Wisconsinites to observe their individual faiths,’ Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and the other members of the Assembly GOP caucus wrote in a Friday letter to Evers. … Evers declined the request. … The Republicans' request came one day before Republicans in the Assembly and Senate stalled Evers' move to push back Tuesday's election due to the coronavirus pandemic ravaging countries around the world. On Saturday, they quickly adjourned a special legislative session about the matter. During Saturday's proceedings, the state Assembly and state Senate each gaveled in and out within seconds and recessed until Monday.”What to expect - FiveThirtyEight: “As of Sunday, 1,268,587 absentee ballots had been requested for the election — far more than election officials are equipped to handle. Not only is that almost six times as many as were cast in Wisconsin’s 2016 presidential primary, but it’s also probably a higher volume of absentee ballots than Wisconsin has ever handled. In the 2016 general election, for instance, only 819,316 absentee ballots were counted. In addition to the avalanche of ballots arriving by mail, polling places may also be overwhelmed on Tuesday due to a dire shortage of poll workers. As of last Tuesday, almost 60 percent of municipalities in Wisconsin did not have enough poll workers, and more than 100 did not have any. The situation was critical enough that Evers has asked members of the Wisconsin Army National Guard to staff some precincts, but it is still not expected to be enough.”Biden says Milwaukee convention may be 'virtual' - ABC News: “Former Vice President Joe Biden said Sunday on ABC's ‘This Week’ that the recently delayed Democratic Convention will have to happen, but conceded that it may need to be held virtually if the novel coronavirus continues to pose a public health threat by mid-August. ‘Well, we're going to have to do a convention. We may have to do a virtual convention. I think we should be thinking about that right now. The idea of holding the convention is going to be necessary. We may not be able to put 10, 20, 30,000 people in one place and that's very possible. Again let's see where it is -- and what we do between now and then is going to dictate a lot of that as well. But my point is that I think you just got to follow the science,’ Biden told ABC News' Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos.”THE RULEBOOK: TOUGH ENOUGH NOT TO FIGHT “The rights of neutrality will only be respected when they are defended by an adequate power.

Music City, after all, gets its moniker not from country alone, but from the history of diverse music made in town, from the Fisk Jubilee Singers to R&B along Jefferson Street to, of course, rock and roll. ‘There’s music everywhere in Nashville,’ says Darius Rucker, who has signed on to be one of the museum’s national chairs. … Rucker himself knows about playing across genres, making the leap from being the lead singer and guitarist for the multiplatinum Hootie & the Blowfish to a chart-topping country artist and the first African American with a number-one country song since Charley Pride. … As the National Museum of African American Music builds programming for younger generations, Rucker’s causes for children and music history will likely converge—yet another reason to sing.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARDESTIMATED DELEGATES FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATIONBiden: 1,217Sanders: 914[Ed. note: 1,991 delegates needed to win]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE Average approval: 48.4 percentAverage disapproval: 47.8 percentNet Score: 0.6 percentChange from one week ago: ↑ 1.4 points[Average includes: Grinnell/Selzer: 48% approve - 48% disapprove; ABC News/WaPo: 49% approve - 47% disapprove; Fox News: 48% approve - 51% disapprove; Gallup: 49% approve - 45% disapprove; Monmouth University: 48% approve - 48% disapprove.]WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT? You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

Talk to you soon!  TRUMP MAY TAP ECON TEAM TO MIRROR VIRUS SQUAD Bloomberg: “President Donald Trump said he’s ‘thinking about’ forming a panel to examine how best to restart the country’s economy, which he earlier termed a ‘good idea.’ ‘I’m thinking about it,’ Trump said Saturday at a White House Press conference. ‘I continue to say, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself.’ … Trump early tweeted an endorsement of a plan offered by Dana Perino, former press secretary to President George W. Bush. Perino, now [the anchor of “The Daily Briefing” on Fox News, suggested assembling ‘a nonpartisan/bipartisan mix of experts across industry sectors’ who could advise the president about overcoming the economic difficulties stemming from harsh social districting measures suggested by the federal government. Perino said this group would complement the team led by Vice President Mike Pence, which includes health, national security and emergency preparedness officials. ‘Let 1st task force focus on crisis at the moment,’ Perino tweeted.”Dems divided on how to target Trump over economic implosion - Politico: “For most of the presidential campaign... many Democrats acknowledged they had no cohesive economic message of their own. But now that the coronavirus has laid waste to the surging stock market and low unemployment, Democrats are discovering another obstacle — framing a coherent economic argument that all the party’s factions can rally around. It’s already become a source of friction within the Democratic Party, even as some major Democratic outside groups begin pummeling Trump for the economic fallout of the pandemic. It’s a message Democrats plan to amplify in coming months, long after the immediate health effects of the crisis subside. The left flank is increasing pressure on Joe Biden, the party’s likely nominee, to adopt more progressive economic policies. Activists accuse Trump of prioritizing corporate America over low-wage workers, while many moderate Democrats are leery of drawing such distinctions, training their criticism of Trump solely on his initial mishandling of the pandemic.”Vernon Smith: Economy will bounce back, but beware inflation - WSJ: “A more common postcrisis question may be whether policy makers overreacted when fear and uncertainty were at their height. We will never know the answer, but the current anxiety of economic doom will surely pass along with the pandemic. In fact, with more money chasing goods in stretched production schedules, inflation is a real possibility. Inflation disrupts and distorts the ability of the pricing system to coordinate and direct economic productivity. When everyone rushes to spend for fear that prices will rise, we observe the destructive opposite of what happens when everyone is stuck at home. Witness the nightmare inflation rates in Zimbabwe and Venezuela.”Crisis offers Rubio an opportunity - Politico: “As chairman of the usually sleepy Small Business Committee, [Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.] has a key position in the country’s response and recovery from the pandemic. His panel’s $377 billion lifeline for small businesses is a linchpin of Congress’ $2 trillion economic rescue package, and Rubio’s efforts are winning praise from Republicans and Democrats alike even as implementation of the program remains deeply uncertain. … In the span of a decade, he’s gone from tea party rising star to immigration deal-cutter and top-tier presidential contender to foot soldier in Trump’s Republican Party. Now, Rubio’s emergence as a leading responder to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus is fueling talk among his colleagues that he, like a handful of prominent Senate Republicans, is keeping an eye on where his party goes in 2024, when Trump is no longer the GOP’s standard-bearer.”FIRED I.G. SAYS IT WAS TRUMP’S RETRIBUTIONFox News: “Michael Atkinson broke his silence Sunday saying he's ‘disappointed and saddened’ at President Trump's late-night decision [Friday] to fire him from his watchdog post in the intelligence community. ‘It is hard not to think that the president's loss of confidence in me derives from my having faithfully discharged my legal obligations as an independent and impartial inspector general, and from my commitment to continue to do so,’ Atkinson wrote in a two-page statement. The watchdog had alerted Congress to concerns about a Trump phone call with the president of Ukraine – a matter that led to the president’s impeachment last year. Atkinson stood by his decision to disclose a whistleblower's complaint against Trump, adding: ‘Those of us who vowed to protect a whistleblower's right to safely be heard must, to the end, do what we promised to do, no matter how difficult and no matter the personal consequences.’”Trump not sorry - NYT: “Mr. Trump made no effort at a news briefing on Saturday to pretend that the dismissal was anything other than retribution for Mr. Atkinson’s action under a law requiring such complaints be disclosed to lawmakers. ‘I thought he did a terrible job, absolutely terrible,’ Mr. Trump said. ‘He took a fake report and he brought it to Congress.’ Capping a long, angry denunciation of the impeachment, he added, ‘The man is a disgrace to I.G.s. He’s a total disgrace.’ Mr. Trump’s hunt for informers and turncoats proceeds even while most Americans are focused on the coronavirus outbreak that has killed thousands and shut down most of the country. The president’s determination to wipe out perceived treachery underscores his intense distrust of the government that he oversees at a time when he is relying on career public health and emergency management officials to help guide him through one of the most dangerous periods in modern American history.”BIDEN SAYS HE’LL BE THE MASKED CANDIDATEFox News: “Add personally wearing face masks to the already large list of areas where President Trump and Joe Biden disagree. The president – in announcing that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended Americans wear facial coverings made of cloth while out in public to help stop the spread of the coronavirus pandemic – repeatedly called the recommendation ‘voluntary’ and said he wouldn’t be wearing a mask himself. ‘You don't have to do it,’ the president said on Friday. ‘I'm choosing not to do it, but some people may want to do it and that's OK. It may be good. Probably will.’ … Biden, the former vice president and likely Democratic presidential nominee, said he would wear a mask in public when asked during an interview on ABC’s ‘This Week.’ … Biden added, ‘he may not like how he looks in a mask but the truth of the matter is that -- follow the science.’”Giuliani a big booster for Trump’s pet malaria drug - WaPo: “Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was in the center of the impeachment storm earlier this year as an unpaid private attorney for President Trump, has cast himself in a new role: as personal science adviser to a president eager to find ways to short-circuit the coronavirus pandemic. In one-on-one phone calls with Trump, Giuliani said, he has been touting the use of an anti-malarial drug combination that has shown some early promise in treating covid-19, the disease the novel coronavirus causes, but whose effectiveness has not yet been proved. He said he now spends his days on the phone with doctors, coronavirus patients and hospital executives promoting the treatment, which Trump has also publicly lauded. ‘I discussed it with the president after he talked about it,’ Giuliani said in an interview. ‘I told him what I had on the drugs.’”Carney: ‘Dr. Fauci was correct -- more importantly, he was humble.’ -  WashEx: “In certain political circles, it has apparently become important to knock Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. … So, no, Fauci wasn’t predicting a pandemic. But he also wasn't saying there would be no pandemic. He was expressing uncertainty about a new and mysterious disease, and warning that it could become really bad. Everybody is wrong sometimes. The key is that when we speak about the future, especially, we should acknowledge the possibility we may be wrong.”PLAY-BY-PLAYHow a history book got George W.

I was not alive during FDR's terms, but believe his team had to confront challenges most similar to those that confront us today. That said, I don't believe his team had to confront as deep political divides as we face today.  Am I current on that? I have great respect for Reagan, Baker and O'Neil as individuals and how they worked together to kill inflation (with Volker's help) and address a very deep recession. The political divide between Tip and Ronald was huge, but they made it seem entirely manageable through their maturity, humanity and sense of humor.

"4461","Americans in areas where the outbreak of the novel coronavirus has hit hardest may soon receive updated guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to wear a face-covering or homemade mask when out in public. But when making a do-it-yourself mask, what materials should you use if you have sensitive skin? What should you do if your skin becomes irritated from long-term use?","1568138397","1"
"4462","Fox News asked Dr. Erum Ilyas, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of the protective clothing line AmberNoon, for the best guidelines when it comes to making a homemade mask. Read on for a look at what she had to say below.","1568138397","1"
"4463","Fox News: What are the best materials to use for a homemade face mask?","1568138397","1"
"4464","Dr. Ilyas: The talk of DIY face masks is focused currently on blocking viral spread. Traditionally, in the medical setting facial masks are usually used to block the spread of bacteria. Viruses measure less than one micron in size and can escape most fabrics. Viruses are much smaller than bacteria. Various household materials have been studied to determine their ability to block viruses and bacteria.","1568138397","1"
"4465","Choosing the right material first can determine your best chances of blocking viruses as well as ensure comfort to make you more likely to keep the mask on! A study looking at various household fabrics to block the spread of influenza years ago showed that cotton and polyester blends tend to be the most effective out of household materials while still maintaining breathability.","1568138397","1"
"4466","Fox News: How could a face mask irritate your skin and what should you do about it if it does?","1568138397","1"
"4467","Ilyas: In the past 15 years of practice I only had to wear a face mask for surgical excisions of skin cancers or procedures that risked splash to the face. Over the course of a day, I would use a mask on and off maybe 10 to15 times. I never felt that they irritated or bothered my skin.","1568138397","1"
"4468","Now, after spending the last three weeks in continuous use of a face mask 6 to 10 hours a day, my skin is feeling the effects. It’s multi-fold. There is friction of the mask over the nose where the clip lies. The pressure of the mask as it grips the cheeks, under-eye area, and chin to achieve a good fit to minimize the risk of exposure to virus around the edges of the mask. The humidity of our breath inside the mask can also lead to some chafing of the skin around the mouth as well.","1568138397","1"
"4469","To help offset these effects it’s a good idea to be proactive and use a good moisturizer every night to help restore and repair the skin. Try to choose a gentle cleanser when washing the face to avoid further irritation of the skin. If you are struggling with acne, it may be worth backing off of some of our traditional acne treatments such as ones containing salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and retinoids. These products work by drying or exfoliating the skin. This effect can be aggravated by the routine use of face masks. Consider talking to your dermatologist (via telehealth of course) about options to treat and control acne through less irritating means such as oral antibiotics or topicals containing azelaic acid.","1568138397","1"
"4470","I have seen a lot of rosacea flares with mask use lately which can be another reason to think about re-evaluating your skin routine.","1568138397","1"
"4471","Fox News: Can those with sensitive skin still wear masks? ","1568138397","1"
"4472","Ilyas: People with sensitive skin can definitely still wear face masks. If they feel that their skin is irritated it can help to use moisturizers that rehydrate the skin and also serve as a barrier for the skin to protect it. Products that contain ceramides, squalene, niacinamide, and/or hyaluronic acid can help.","1568138397","1"
"4473"," Fox News: What are the pros and cons of wearing a mask at this time?","1568138397","1"
"4474","Ilyas: There are a lot of mixed messages out there about whether wearing a mask can help at this time. I believe it is beneficial for the simple fact that wearing a mask is a two-way street -- they protect you from others and others from you. At this time of uncertainty, it’s likely simpler to assume all are positive for the coronavirus and take measures to protect ourselves and others through simple methods. Wearing a face mask is by no means 100 percent effective, but it’s pretty close to 70 percent for certain household materials.","1568138397","1"
"4475","The con of wearing a face mask is a false sense of security that we could feel “invincible” by wearing one. Face masks are not a permission slip to go back to a normal routine. Social distancing is still important to maintain with homemade face masks. They are an added level of security, but far from perfect.","1568138397","1"

"4486","Accumulating data from around the planet indicates that those infected are frequently symptom-free, or suffer from minor symptoms that are easily confused with other respiratory viruses. Therefore, it would seem that the only way to prevent spread in the absence of a vaccine or a significant community immunity (pandemics are too new for the population to have built up enough immunity to slow down the virus) would be social distancing, shutting down society and keeping as many people at home as possible. A recent study in Nature Medicine suggests that the use of surgical masks when worn in public may be helpful as wells.","1569490736","1"
"4487","But the problem is that the testing is cumbersome, inefficient, often inaccurate and requires personal protective equipment that we would much prefer to see used in hospitals, clinics, doctor’s offices and ambulances. Plus, in most places there are only enough tests for the severely ill to receive them, which means that I and others have to diagnose our patients as having COVID 19 by clinical observations alone. This leads to too many people having it without knowing they have it, which increases the risk of spread despite all the social distancing and face mask-wearing.","1569490736","1"

"4547","For the first time, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that even seemingly healthy people wear masks over their mouths and noses when venturing out of their homes into places where it is difficult to maintain distance from other people. But there is still major debate over how much masks — particularly the homemade fabric masks that the CDC recommends for the public — can slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.","1577664136","1"
"4548","Researchers, writing in two new papers, attempt to tackle the efficacy of masks, one more rigorously than the other, and come to differing conclusions. One study examined the effect of masks on seasonal coronaviruses (which cause many cases of the common cold) and found that surgical masks are helpful at reducing how much virus a sick person spreads. The other looked particularly at SARS-CoV-2 and found no effect of either surgical or fabric masks on reducing virus spread, but only had four participants and used a crude measure of viral spread.","1577664136","1"
"4549","The bottom line, experts say, is that masks might help keep people with COVID-19 from unknowingly passing along the virus. But the evidence for the efficacy of surgical or homemade masks is limited, and masks aren't the most important protection against the coronavirus.","1577664136","1"
"4550","""Putting a face mask on does not mean that you stop the other practices,"" said May Chu, a clinical professor in epidemiology at the Colorado School of Public Health on the Anschutz Medical Campus who was not involved in either new study. ""It does not mean you get closer to people, it does not mean you don't have to wash your hands as often and you can touch your face. All of that still is in place, this is just an add-on.""","1577664136","1"
"4551","Recommendations about masks can easily get confusing, because all masks are not made equal. The N95 mask effectively prevents viral spread. These masks, when properly fitted, seal closely to the face and filter out 95% of particles 0.3 microns or larger. But N95 masks are in serious shortage even for medical professionals, who are exposed to the highest levels of SARS-CoV-2 and are most in need of the strongest protection against the virus. They're also difficult to fit correctly. For those reasons, the CDC does not recommend them for general use.","1577664136","1"
"4552","Due to shortages, the CDC also does not recommend surgical masks for the general public. These masks don't seal against the face but do include non-woven polypropylene layers that are moisture resistant. In a surgical mask, about 70% of the outside air moves through the mask and about 30% travels around the sides, Chu told Live Science. For that reason, they don't offer as much protection as N95s.","1577664136","1"
"4553","That leaves fabric masks, which currently are recommended for general use by the CDC. Fabric masks also allow air in around the sides, but lack non-woven, moisture-repelling layers. They impede only about 2% of airflow in, Chu said.","1577664136","1"
"4554","All of this leakage in surgical and fabric masks are why public health officials generally don't believe that wearing a mask prevents anyone from catching a virus that is already floating around in the environment. Airflow follows the path of least resistance, said Rachael Jones, an associate professor of family and preventive medicine at the University of Utah who was not involved in the new research. If viral particles are nearby, they have an easy path around a surgical or fabric mask. And in the case of a fabric mask, wearers may well be wafting in particles small enough to flow right through the fabric.","1577664136","1"
"4555","But what about the other way around? When the wearer of a mask coughs or sneezes, the barrier might be enough to contain a lot of that initial jet of grossness — even if there are gaps in the fabric or around the sides. That's what the new mask studies aimed to address: Whether surgical or fabric masks did a good job of containing viruses.","1577664136","1"
"4556","One study, published April 6 in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, found that they did not. That study, led by South Korean researchers, involved asking four patients with COVID-19 to cough into a petri dish 7.8 inches (20 centimeters) away. The patients coughed without masks, while wearing a disposable surgical mask and again wearing a 100% cotton mask.","1577664136","1"
"4557","Neither mask meaningfully decreased the viral load coughed onto the petri dishes. But experts not involved in the study who were contacted by Live Science were hesitant to put much stock into the findings. The researchers didn't look at distances beyond 7.8 inches to see if droplets didn't travel as far while people were wearing masks, Chu said.","1577664136","1"
"4558","The study also returned the odd result that most swabs from the outside of patient masks were positive for coronavirus and most from the inside were negative. The authors speculate that perhaps turbulent jets of air from coughing carried the virus toward the outside of the mask, but the explanation wasn't very satisfying, according to Jones.","1577664136","1"
"4559","The other study, published April 3 in the journal Nature Medicine, used a more sophisticated method of collecting the virus particles that sick people emit. The researchers asked 426 volunteers to breathe for 30 minutes into a cone-like device that captures everything exhaled. Of these, 43 patients had influenza, 54 patients had rhinoviruses and 17 patients had seasonal coronaviruses (the kinds that cause colds, not the kind that causes COVID-19). This method allowed the researchers to quantify how much virus was found in droplet particles, which are greater than 0.0002 inches (5 microns) in diameter, versus aerosol particles, which are 5 microns or smaller. The participants were randomized to either wear a surgical mask or not wear a mask during the study.","1577664136","1"
"4560","And as for masks? Surgical masks reduced the amount of virus released from a sick person in the form of droplets but not aerosols for influenza; the masks reduced coronavirus in both droplets and aerosols; and they didn't reduce either in rhinovirus. For the seasonal coronavirus, researchers found the virus in droplets in 3 out of 10 samples from participants not wearing masks and in aerosols in 4 out of 10 samples taken without masks. In samples taken with masks, no virus was detected in either droplets or aerosols.","1577664136","1"
"4561","The results from influenza and seasonal coronaviruses suggest that surgical masks can help keep people with COVID-19 from spreading the virus, Cowling said. SARS-CoV-2 probably behaves similarly to the viruses he and his team studied, he said, and the fact that people can spread the virus before they experience symptoms is an argument for recommending masks for everyone.","1577664136","1"
"4562","But experts are still mixed on the potential usefulness of non-N95 masks.","1577664136","1"
"4563","""To me, it's not harmful to wear these masks, but it doesn't look from this study like there is a whole lot of benefit,"" Jones said. The sample size for seasonal coronavirus was small, she said, and there was a large amount of non-mask-related variation in how much virus people emitted, particularly given that the majority of samples without masks didn't have detectable coronavirus.","1577664136","1"
"4564","One thing everyone does agree on is that, whatever containment provided by non-fitted masks do provide, homemade fabric masks are the least effective. The recommendations that everyone wear masks are because ""any kind of impediment is better than nothing,"" Chu said. But fabric masks are not expected to be as protective as surgical masks, she said. That's why public health officials are warning people to remain at least 6 feet apart from one another, even if they are wearing masks. In other words, homemade masks are likely to be just a small piece of the puzzle for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.","1577664136","1"
"4565","""There's been enough research done to be able to confidently say that masks wouldn't be able to stop the spread of infection, that they would only have a small effect on transmission,"" Cowling said. ""We shouldn't be relying on masks to help us go back to normal.""","1577664136","1"

"4579","The issue about whether the virus can be transmitted through the air is likely to find it's way into the debate on if the general public should be wearing masks to protect against COVID-19.

John Prine, who died from COVID-19 complications on Tuesday at age 73, was never one of them. From his debut album in 1971, Prine was one of the greatest songwriters America has ever produced, someone who embraced the underdog sensibilities and poetic grace of his chief influences: Hank Williams, Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie. … John twice won a Grammy for best folk album and was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Recording Academy. His body of work is an American treasure.

Some poll workers wore hazmat suits. Nearly every voter wore a face mask, removing it only to make small talk that reflected a combination of determination and grim humor about the extraordinary experience of voting amid a deadly pandemic. … Like so much else in Wisconsin, the scene was markedly different outside the main urban areas. Republican county chairs boasted about their smooth process throughout the day, with short lines and ample room for a smattering of voters who often showed little signs of the current health crisis — no masks, no gloves. … But in Milwaukee, where there are more than 1,000 confirmed cases of the virus and at least 87 people have died of it, many voters cast their ballots wearing full protective gear, some overtaken with fear.”Trump denounces voting by mail - Fox News: “President Trump is turning up the volume in his opposition to expanding voting by mail and absentee ballots as a way to minimize health risks posed by voting in-person during the coronavirus pandemic. ‘Mail-in voting is horrible. It's corrupt,’ the president argued during Tuesday’s daily Coronavirus Task Force press briefing at the White House. Trump then suggested that ‘you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in someone's living room signing ballots all over the place…I think that mail-in voting is a terrible thing.’ The president didn’t offer any evidence to back up his claim that voting by mail is rampant with fraud and abuse. The president’s comments follow a similar attack on voting by mail at Friday’s briefing, when he charged that ‘a lot of people cheat with mail-in voting.’”Ballot fight headed to battleground Florida -  Politico: “Election supervisors in Florida warned Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday that he needs to change the law to give them more flexibility to avoid a presidential election meltdown in the nation’s biggest swing state. The county officials — who issued the red alert on the same day Wisconsin held a disastrous primary amid widespread fears and irregularities due to the coronavirus — said the changes are needed to accommodate more absentee ballot voters, who could be scared away from the polls if the coronavirus outbreak persists into the August primary or the November general election. ‘Florida is not in a position, at this time, to conduct an all-mail ballot election this year,’ Tammy Jones, supervisor for Levy County and the president of the Florida Supervisors of Elections, wrote DeSantis in a letter sent Tuesday on behalf of the 67 officials who run elections in the state.”POLL SHOWS MASSIVE ECONOMIC DAMAGECNBC: “A quarter of  Americans have either lost their job or seen their wages cut as a result of the coronavirus shutdown, according to the CNBC All-America Economic Survey, which registered the biggest and fastest decline ever in the public’s view of the economy. At the same time, it found that a majority of Americans remains optimistic that the economy will bounce back in the next year, and President Donald Trump’s approval rating has improved. … Nine percent believe unemployment or a pay cut await them. The poll has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points. The percentage of Americans saying the economy is now good or excellent fell to just 22%, giving up the gains of the Trump presidency, and falling further than it ever did after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks or the Great Recession in 2008.”Voters souring on federal response - CNN: “A majority of Americans -- 55% -- now say the federal government has done a poor job preventing the spread of coronavirus in the United States, up eight points in about a week, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS as the nationwide death toll from the virus rose above 12,000. Eighty percent feel the worst of the outbreak is yet to come, most (55%) feel President Donald Trump could be doing more to fight the outbreak, and 37% say they have grown more concerned about coronavirus in the last few days, far outpacing the 5% who say their fears have eased recently. About 1 in 5 (22%) say they personally know someone who has been diagnosed with the virus, a figure that is double the share who said so in a Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted just two weeks ago. Just under half (46%) say it is at least somewhat likely that they or someone in their family will contract the coronavirus…”PLAY-BY-PLAYPostal Service, already struggling, sees business collapse during pandemic - NPRPennsylvania closes liquor stores forcing residents to go out of state for booze - ReasonCoronavirus stimulus checks are on their way: Here's how it works -Fox NewsPergram: Coronavirus shakes up the best beat in Washington - Fox NewsAUDIBLE: WE NEED SOME FROSTED MINI-WHEATS ASAP!“If you’re studying out of the textbook, it’s pretty abstract.

I happen to believe when Team Red won the House in '94 began the beginning of today's bitter divide between parties. For 40 years prior Team Blue was in charge, including during the Reagan years. In November 1994 the country chose a different direction for the House which, in turn, upset more Democrats and media folks than all of the events in the 80's and prior. I remember ABC's Peter Jennings on election night referring to American voters as having, ‘thrown their temper tantrum’ by switching the House. Four years later Republicans, to their detriment in my opinion, impeached President Clinton. ...

"4713","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may soon agree with this assessment; the agency currently states that healthy people do not need to wear face masks unless they are caring for someone who is ill with the new coronavirus. But an anonymous federal official said that the CDC may change these guidelines, in effect encouraging people to cover their faces in public, The Washington Post reported on March 30.","1566348303","1"
"4714","That said, the public does not need to wear face masks most of the time, said Dr. Otto Yang, a professor in the Department of Medicine and the Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles.","1566348303","1"
"4715","If you're out for a walk — in essence, going to a setting where you can be at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) from other people, ""then I think that not having a mask is fine and that fits the CDC recommendations,"" Yang said.","1566348303","1"
"4716","But, in his opinion, ""If you have to be in a crowded situation, perhaps on a plane or waiting in line at the airport, it might make sense to wear a mask,"" Yang told Live Science.","1566348303","1"
"4717","The discussion about face masks has become a national conversation. Many people in the public are buying face masks to protect themselves. But health care experts have urged against hoarding, since these supplies are desperately needed in hospitals. Even the U.S. surgeon general tweeted ""Seriously people — STOP BUYING MASKS!""","1566348303","1"
"4718","""The CDC, it's like they're talking out of both sides of their mouth,"" Yang said. ""One side of their mouth is telling the general public, 'Hey, you don't need masks, forget about it.' The other side is, 'Health care workers need to wear N95 respirators.'""","1566348303","1"
"4719","Some of the confusion about ""masks versus N95 respirators"" exists because so little is known about COVID-19. At first, it wasn't clear if the virus spread predominantly through large respiratory droplets (like influenza) or also through a fine mist, called an aerosol, which can linger for hours (like measles). This great unknown made it unclear whether a heavy-duty mask, known as an N95 respirator, which blocks the smallest virus particles, or a regular surgical mask, which only blocks larger droplets, was better suited to protect against the virus.","1566348303","1"
"4720","In other words, except in certain hospital situations such as a bronchoscopy, which essentially creates a fine mist of virus, SARS-CoV-2 is likely spread mostly through droplets, like the flu, Yang said. That's supported by a Feb. 24 case report in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, which found a man sick with COVID-19 on a flight from China to Canada in January did not infect his fellow passengers, even though he had a dry cough during the 15-hour flight. The man was wearing a face mask, but because no one else on the plane got infected, this case ""supports droplet transmission, not airborne, as the likely route of spread of the COVID-19,"" the researchers of the case study found.","1566348303","1"
"4721","Due to the N95 respirator shortage, the CDC recently relaxed its guidelines, saying that among health care workers, face masks were ""an acceptable alternative when the supply chain of respirators cannot meet the demand,"" except in situations when respiratory aerosols might be produced, such as intubation or nebulizer treatments.","1566348303","1"
"4722","In addition to the shortage, N95 respirators are challenging to put on. Doctors receive annual training on how to mold the respirator around the face. As a test, doctors put on a hood and have the artificial sweetener saccharin sprayed in. ""If you're wearing the mask properly, you don't taste any saccharin,"" Yang said. But most people do, he noted.","1566348303","1"
"4723","In a nutshell, the public does not need N95 respirators; they likely will not be in a situation where they're exposed to aerosol of the virus, and these masks are needed by health care workers who will, Yang said.","1566348303","1"
"4724","However, even regular face masks are in short supply, prompting the CDC to recommend the use of bandannas and scarves when necessary. There's not a lot of research on homemade masks, but a small 2013 study found that masks made from cotton T-shirts were effective, though not as good as surgical masks.","1566348303","1"
"4725","""The surgical mask was three times more effective in blocking transmission [of microorganisms] than the homemade mask,"" the researchers of that study found, who noted that homemade masks ""should only be considered as a last resort to prevent droplet transmission from infected individuals.""","1566348303","1"
"4726","For people opting to use scarves and homemade masks, Yang recommended washing them after every use, and to stop wearing them when damp from breathing. Wearing eye protection, such as a face shield or goggles, could also physically block the virus, said Yang and Dr. James Cherry, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at the David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California at Los Angeles.","1566348303","1"
"4727","In a 1987 study Cherry did with colleagues, health care workers who wore face masks or goggles were less likely to get respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) from hospitalized children than doctors who did not take these measures.","1566348303","1"
"4728","However, unlike Yang, Cherry agreed with the current CDC guidelines, and said that except for certain exceptions, the public doesn't need to wear face masks, as did Dr. Jaimie Meyer, an infectious disease specialist at Yale Medicine. That's especially true given that the safest way to avoid being exposed, or exposing others, is to simply stay home.","1566348303","1"
"4729","""The current CDC guidance says the general public does not need to be wearing surgical masks,"" Meyer told Live Science. ""The best protection is to focus on social distancing, hand-washing, not touching their faces and bleaching high touch surfaces.""","1566348303","1"

"4738","""It's not just the hospitals that need this, but everybody,"" Loder said.

"4803","From day one of the coronavirus outbreak, the public has gotten the run around about masks. Government officials need to be honest about what works and what doesn’t. Here’s the scientific evidence:","1582731487","1"
"4804","N95 masks, which are molded and fit tight to the face, filter out 95 percent of viral particles, even the smallest ones. These masks offer the best protection, but they are in short supply, and public officials want them reserved for health care workers on the front lines.","1582731487","1"
"4805","Surgical masks, the kind you see commonly worn in hospitals and dentists’ offices, are flat and held to the face with elastic. They’re made from a nonwoven material, polypropylene, that is a somewhat effective filter. They protect the wearer from about 56 percent of viral droplets emitted by an infected person nearby, according to research in the British Medical Journal.","1582731487","1"
"4806","Not so woven cloth masks. They allow in 97 percent of viral particles. That means almost no protection for the wearer at all.","1582731487","1"
"4807","Wearing a homemade cotton mask is a false assurance, explains epidemiologist May Chu. She says it will block only about 2 percent of airflow. Similarly, a study in Disaster Medical and Public Health Preparedness concludes that a homemade mask should be considered “only as a last resort,” better than no protection at all but not a lot better.","1582731487","1"
"4808","Surgical masks seem available in stores now, and if you can buy a supply, using them is far preferable to making your own. Don’t reuse the mask and avoid touching the outside of the mask, because it’s likely contaminated after use.","1582731487","1"
"4809","Getting everyone to mask up helps to protect the uninfected, and keeps the unknowingly infected from spreading the virus.","1582731487","1"
"4810","Why are public officials suddenly urging mask use, many weeks after the Coronavirus struck? Because of mounting research pointing to the huge role of asymptomatic people spreading the disease before they feel ill. Whenever these asymptomatic carriers talk or simply exhale, they spread very small droplets of virus-laden saliva and respiratory mucous in the air. Scientists call it bioaerosols.","1582731487","1"
"4811","Getting everyone to mask up helps to protect the uninfected, and keeps the unknowingly infected from spreading the virus. As New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, announcing the mask mandate: “You don’t have a right to infect me.”","1582731487","1"
"4812","Makes sense, but Americans have had to put up with a lot of message confusion from the outset, and now they’re getting misleading advice about homemade masks.","1582731487","1"
"4813","What’s the root problem? Year after year after year, through three presidencies, federal health bureaucrats ignored warnings about inadequate supplies of masks and other equipment in the event of a pandemic. Ten federal reports sounded the alarm, even as the nation witnessed SARS, MERS, avian flu and swine flu that circled the globe. In 2009, during the swine flu outbreak, the federal Strategic National Stockpile dispersed 85 million N95 masks, as well as other protective masks. The masks were never replaced afterward.","1582731487","1"
"4814","Don’t blame any president, Democratic or Republican, for this oversight. The career officials at Health and Human Services knowingly allowed the nation to be undersupplied. They never requested enough money to adequately stock the Strategic National Stockpile. Their agenda was global, tracking down polio in Pakistan, pouring nearly $5 billion in the fight against Ebola overseas, and funding a Global Health Security Agenda serving 49 countries. But no masks for Americans.","1582731487","1"
"4815","When the coronavirus struck here, the CDC offered only mask double talk. The agency said on the one hand masks are vital to protect health care workers, and on the other hand, masks won’t make the public safer. It defies common sense. The agency should have leveled with people, admitting supplies had to be saved for front line caregivers.","1582731487","1"
"4816","The coronavirus could return next winter. Or another viral pandemic could strike from any part of the globe. The bill Congress enacted in late March allocates $16 billion to the Strategic National Stockpile, nearly 30 times its annual budget. Next time the U.S. will have enough masks.","1582731487","1"

Throughout his 20 years umpiring in the minor and major leagues, he was almost always the only black umpire on the field, and was sometimes subjected to racial epithets. But Ashford weathered these with grace. Today, the Spalding face mask he wore behind the plate is a tangible reminder of the courageous men and women who integrated U.S. sports after World War II. Still, only ten African-Americans have followed directly in Ashford’s footsteps, and it wasn’t until this past February that Major League Baseball hired its first black umpire crew chief, Kerwin Danley. … Ashford’s entry into umpiring was largely accidental. … For one game in 1941, the story goes, the scheduled umpire didn’t show up, and Ashford was asked to fill in. … One game led to another, and he soon established himself as a better umpire than ballplayer.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCEAverage approval: 46 percentAverage disapproval: 49.2 percentNet Score: -3.2 pointsChange from one week ago: ↓ 0.2 points[Average includes: NBC News/WSJ: 46% approve - 51% disapprove; Gallup: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; Fox News: 49% approve - 49% disapprove; Monmouth University: 46% approve - 49% disapprove; CNBC: 46% approve - 43% disapprove.] WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT? You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

The legislation that the House will take up, which passed the Senate Tuesday, includes $320 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, designed to help struggling small businesses keep their workers on the payroll. It’s widely regarded as an interim step as the coronavirus pandemic continues to cause death and economic havoc. ‘We’re ready to go on to the next bill,’ House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday morning on MSNBC. Both parties are looking at follow-up legislation that would be more comprehensive and costly. President Donald Trump, who met Tuesday with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, said aid to state and local governments would be part of a so-called phase four stimulus, as would money for road projects and expanding broadband service.”McConnell pumps the brakes on next one - Politico: “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is drawing a line: There will be no more attempts at long-distance legislating on the coronavirus. In a telephone interview Tuesday after passage of a $484 billion coronavirus relief bill, the Senate majority leader made clear that the full Senate must be in session before Congress begins its fifth installment of responding to the pandemic. And he signaled he is growing weary of quickly shoveling billions of dollars out the door even as the economy continues to crater. The latest measure cleared the Senate by voice vote, but it was the product of days of fraught negotiations and false starts — and its success will be difficult to replicate as senators' frustrations over the extended recess pile up. McConnell said the Senate will proceed ‘cautiously’ to the next phase of coronavirus relief despite rapidly escalating demands for more aid from members of both parties. And he said that all 100 senators need to be around before Washington spends more money on an unprecedented economic rescue of workers and businesses caught in the virus’ fallout.”Some Senate Republicans buck Trump on testing - WaPo: “Congressional Republicans have strongly backed President Trump’s efforts to respond to the deadly coronavirus pandemic and its crippling impact on the economy… But on the issue of testing, some Senate Republicans are looking for ways to get the federal government to play a bigger role despite Trump’s insistence it is an issue that governors should handle. Led by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Senate Republicans have largely envisioned the federal government taking a lead role in experimenting with diagnostic and serological tests for the coronavirus, even if some of the ideas ultimately fail — the thinking being that the government can take chances that perhaps the private sector cannot. ‘We’re encouraging some risk-taking here,’ Blunt said in an interview Tuesday. There is about $1 billion allocated for that effort in the a $484 billion economic stimulus agreement that cleared the Senate on Tuesday afternoon.”Pelosi sidelines plan for proxy voting after GOP backlash - Fox News: “House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has temporarily sidelined a push to allow proxy voting in the House after Republicans slammed the Democrat-crafted plan -- which was designed to mitigate health risks during the coronavirus pandemic but would mark a significant change in how Congress does business. The plan had been slated for a vote Thursday. But Pelosi pulled the plug on a leadership call Wednesday, saying that she and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., would instead set up a group of bipartisan lawmakers to study remote voting and proxy voting as part of a way to reopen the House. … The change of plans happened after House Minority Whip Steve Scalise advised GOP members to vote ‘no’ on the proposal they've dubbed the ‘Pelosi Proxy Voting Scheme’ in the previously scheduled Thursday vote.”CDC director warns of second wave - WaPo: “Even as states move ahead with plans to reopen their economies, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Tuesday that a second wave of the novel coronavirus will be far more dire because it is likely to coincide with the start of flu season. … CDC Director Robert Redfield said in an interview with The Washington Post. … ‘We’re going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time,’ he said. Having two simultaneous respiratory outbreaks would put unimaginable strain on the health-care system, he said. The first wave of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has already killed more than 42,000 people across the country. It has overwhelmed hospitals and revealed gaping shortages in test kits, ventilators and protective equipment for health-care workers.”Barr: DOJ may side with citizens who sue states over 'onerous' coronavirus restrictions - Fox News: “Attorney General Bill Barr took a clear swipe Tuesday at state restrictions on citizens during the coronavirus pandemic, indicating not only that people could sue over measures that go too far but that the Justice Department could end up siding with them against the states. In [a radio interview], Barr specified some of the legal issues raised by state orders – likening some to ‘house arrest’ – and how they could lead the federal government to get involved. ‘Our federal constitutional rights don’t go away in an emergency. They constrain what the government can do,’ Barr said in the Tuesday interview. … The attorney general warned that while some state orders may still be necessary, others may go too far, given that states are seeing progress toward the goal of reducing the spread of the virus.”CORONAVIRUS REMAKES 2020 MAP Politico: “The economic and political impact of the coronavirus crisis is beginning to reverberate across the presidential battleground states, creating unforeseen red-state opportunities for Joe Biden but also offering promise for Donald Trump in several Democratic-leaning states where his prospects once seemed limited. Interviews with more than 30 political strategists, campaign advisers and officials in both parties paint a portrait of an expanded swing state electoral map, upended by the coronavirus pandemic and the economic dislocation it has caused. In the industrial Midwestern states that unexpectedly flipped to Trump in 2016, Democrats have more cause than ever to believe they can win back states such as Wisconsin and Michigan. In Arizona and Georgia, traditionally red states, party officials see the virus’ disproportionate effect on communities of color enhancing conditions for victory. At the same time, the widespread disruption has presented the president with an opportunity to improve his standing in competitive states such as Nevada and New Hampshire, where Trump was presumed to be at a slight disadvantage.”It could delay 2020 results, too - Yahoo News: “Americans have come to expect that they will know who their next president is on election night, but that’s likely to change this fall. In fact, because of a huge increase in mail-in voting in states that are not used to it, the presidential election could take a week or more to be decided. Public officials and advocates are just now beginning to grapple with how to prepare themselves, and the country, for this unprecedented situation. ‘It’s a culture shift that’s going to be required,’ said Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, in an interview. … Gupta, who oversaw the Justice Department’s civil rights division from 2014 to 2017, said her organization — one of the oldest civil rights groups in the country — would work with other groups over the next several months to raise awareness and create an expectation among both voters and journalists that results should not be expected on election night.”Biden campaign leaders cl","1586024291","1"

"5117","For the study, researchers determined the percent particle removal for 10 homemade, fabric masks “of different designs, with and without filter layers, as well as three commercially-produced surgical-type masks.” They noted that “N95 masks were used to validate the method, and a 3M model 1826 surgical mask was used as a baseline for comparison of other masks of this style.”","1590274652","1"
"5118","They used an instrument called a PortaCount to measure how well the masks filtered out air particles, ranging from 20 nanometers to 1,000 nanometers, according to NPR. (For context, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is about 60 to 140 nanometers in diameter.)","1590274652","1"

"5120","""Adding a layer that keeps the mask tight to the face is going to improve the function of any of these masks,"" Fernandez told NPR. “How well they protect us is not only a matter of what material we're using to do the filtering but also how well [the mask] seals to the face, so that we're trying to avoid air making it around the mask into our breathing zone.""","1590274652","1"

It was a day to walk around the property lines and assess your land for the summer season, to mend fences. Women washed their faces with the spring dew so that they would stay beautiful, and there was dancing, tournaments, parades, feasting, and general revelry. … May trees, or Maypoles, were set up covered in rowan or hawthorn flowers as a blessing… and villages would compete with each other to see who could produce the tallest maypole. Young couples went off into the forest to spend the night together and came back the next day with flowers to spread through the village.

This never happened,’ Biden said in a written statement put out by his campaign. ‘While the details of these allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault are complicated, two things are not complicated. One is that women deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced. The second is that their stories should be subject to appropriate inquiry and scrutiny.’ Further, Biden called for the secretary of the Senate to ask the National Archives to ‘identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document.’”Biden OKs Archives search, not personal papers - Fox News: “Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Friday called for a search of the National Archives for any records that might pertain to allegations made against him by former Senate aide Tara Reade — but refused to approve a similar search of his senatorial papers, which are currently stored at the University of Delaware and sealed from the public. … But Biden, in the interview, was pressed on his refusal to approve a similar search of a massive trove of papers from his three-plus decades in the Senate that he donated years ago to the University of Delaware. Biden maintained that the trove would not contain personnel files. ‘There is nothing, they're not there ... The material in the University of Delaware has no personnel files ... but it does have a lot of confidential conversations’ with other officials, like the president and foreign dignitaries, Biden said.”Susan Page: Biden's denial was unequivocal. That doesn't mean he's put this issue to rest. - USA Today: “In the interview, Biden needed to tackle the accusations personally and directly. He did that, in words that left him no wiggle room – stating flatly that it didn't happen, not that he didn't recall, or that this might the result of some sort of misunderstanding. His request to the secretary of the Senate to order a search of his personnel records conveyed his confidence that he had nothing to hide. Biden also needed to square his denials with the standards of the #MeToo movement, including the assertion by some that women who come forward with accusations of harassment deserve to be believed. … Fairly or not, her allegations carry particular peril for Biden because his brand is empathy.”STATES MOVE TO REOPEN, BUT SLOWLYFox News: “America is slowly but surely reopening for business.

President Trump announced a plan on April 16 to reopen the country in three phases, based on the severity of the outbreak in each state or region. And several states believe they meet the criteria to get the ball rolling after a month of shuttered shops, restaurants and people cooped up at home.

The declarations are important because they are the foundation for Whitmer’s stay-at-home measure, which will remain in effect through May 15, and other directives aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. … Whitmer accused GOP lawmakers of ‘putting their heads in the sand and putting more lives and livelihoods at risk. I’m not going to let that happen.’ The legislative pushback came as hundreds of conservative activists, including some who were openly carrying assault rifles, returned to the Capitol to denounce her stay-home order.”Questions mount over Trump son in law’s medical supply plan - Bloomberg: “A program created by Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner has airlifted millions of gloves, masks and other coveted coronavirus supplies into the U.S. from overseas -- but it isn’t clear who’s getting them and at what price, or how much private-sector partners are earning through the arrangement. Kushner’s ‘Project Airbridge’ provides transportation via FedEx Corp. and others for supplies that medical distributors, including McKesson Corp. and Cardinal Health Inc., buy from overseas manufacturers, mainly in China. Once a supplier’s goods arrive in the U.S., the companies must sell half the order in government-designated hotspots. They sell the rest as they see fit.

Lawmakers also are considering other proposals including another round of cash payments to taxpayers, expanded unemployment insurance, assistance to renters and wider broadband access. ‘State and local, I talked about almost $1 trillion right there,’ Pelosi said at her weekly news conference. ‘We are not going to be able to cover all of it, but to the extent we can keep the states and localities sustainable, that is our goal.’”Dems’ push for broadband expansion gains traction - Roll Call: “House Democrats on Thursday renewed their push for an $86 billion broadband expansion, arguing that if the coronavirus pandemic stretches into next fall, students without internet access risk being left behind if schools remain closed.

The projections, based on modeling by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and pulled together in chart form by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, forecast about 200,000 new cases each day by the end of the month, up from about 25,000 cases now. … ‘While mitigation didn’t fail, I think it’s fair to say that it didn’t work as well as we expected,’ Scott Gottlieb, Mr. Trump’s former commissioner of food and drugs, said [to CBS News]. ‘We expected that we would start seeing more significant declines in new cases and deaths around the nation at this point.’”Trump nudges up expected death toll, vows more relief spending - Bloomberg: “President Donald Trump promised more federal help for Americans left jobless by by the pandemic and vowed to press ahead with reopening the economy, addressing the nation in a televised town hall event at the Lincoln Memorial as coronavirus cases and deaths continue to mount. In the opening minutes of the event, broadcast by Fox News, Trump revised upward the number of Americans he expects to be killed by the virus. ‘We’re going to lose anywhere between 75, 80 to 100,000,’ he said. He had said in April he hoped deaths would total less than 60,000; the number of dead so far is more than 67,000. 'Now we have to get it back open,' Trump said, addressing the economic fallout of the shutdown. Trump’s first question, by video, came from an Alabama woman who said she had been unable to apply for unemployment, hadn’t received a federal stimulus check and was feeding her family on donations. ‘There’s more help coming,’ Trump said.”Promises vaccine: ‘you’re going to have it by the end of the year’ - National Review: “President Donald Trump stated that he is ‘very confident’ the U.S. will discover a coronavirus vaccine in the next seven months, following news that his administration has organized a ‘Manhattan Program-esque’ project to fast-track development. ‘We are very confident that we’re going to have a vaccine at the end of the year, by the end of the year,’ Trump told Fox News during a town hall on Sunday night. ‘We think we’re going to have a vaccine by the end of this year. We’re pushing very hard.’ … Pharmaceutical companies, the government, and the military are pooling their efforts, with the goal of 300 million vaccine doses available for Americans by the start of 2021. Experts have been bearish on the prospects of a vaccine in 2020, with most predicting twelve to 18 months before one is widely available to the public.”At memorial to slain Lincoln, Trump says he’s had it worse - WaPo: “Sitting inside the cavernous Lincoln Memorial on Sunday for Fox News’s virtual town hall, President Donald Trump appeared to draw inspiration from his surroundings when asked about why he uses divisive language and dodges questions during White House coronavirus briefings. ‘I am greeted with a hostile press, the likes of which no president has ever seen. The closest would be that gentleman right up there,’ Trump said from his perch on a high-backed stool, pointing at the imposing marble statue of martyred president Abraham Lincoln in the background. Lincoln was assassinated in April, 1865. ‘They always said, ‘Lincoln, nobody got treated worse than Lincoln,’’ Trump continued. ‘I believe I am treated worse.’”Pence regrets not wearing mask - Politico: “Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday said that he should have worn a mask when visiting the Mayo Clinic, a reversal that came after a harsh backlash for not adhering to the hospital’s policy during the coronavirus pandemic. ‘I didn't think it was necessary, but I should have worn a mask at the Mayo Clinic and I wore it when I visited the ventilator plant in Indiana’ two days later, Pence said at a Fox News virtual town hall on Sunday, nodding sheepishly. Pence on Tuesday toured the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., where he met with hospital staff and a patient. According to reporters who were there, every other person present wore a mask. The vice president has said since he is constantly tested for coronavirus and since the mask prevents people from transmitting the virus, he didn’t believe he had to wear one. He reiterated that belief at Sunday’s town hall.”Small businesses collapsing - The Atlantic: “The government is engaged in an unprecedented effort to save such companies as pandemic-related shutdowns stretch into the spring. But Washington’s policies are too complicated, too small, and too slow for many firms: Across the United States, millions of small businesses are struggling, and millions are failing. The great small-business die-off is here, and it will change the landscape of American commerce, auguring slower growth and less innovation in the future. Small businesses went into this recession more fragile than their larger cousins: Before the crisis hit, half of them had less than two weeks’ worth of cash on hand, making it impossible to cover rent, insurance, utilities, and payroll through any kind of sustained downturn. And the coronavirus downturn has indeed been shocking and sustained: Data from credit-card processors suggest that roughly 30 percent of small businesses have shut down during the pandemic.”THE RULEBOOK: THANKS GUYS“The history of Great Britain is the one with which we are in general the best acquainted, and it gives us many useful lessons.

While the coronavirus has tossed the mechanics of politicking in flux for the foreseeable future, leaders in both parties and officials with President Donald Trump and Joe Biden’s campaigns are surveying a relatively stable political battlefield that will be concentrated largely in just about a half dozen states: the former ‘blue wall’ states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the traditional swing states of Florida and North Carolina, and the emerging battleground of Arizona. The common thread among these six states at the center of the general election map is that they were all carried by Trump in 2016, and that the president currently trails in many of the early polls there, leaving him mostly on defense heading into November.”Kraushaar: Republicans look for safe space from Trump - National Journal: “Here are some staples of the GOP’s pre-pandemic thinking: Republicans should embrace the president at all costs, even in swing states where his job approval is underwater. It’s more important to rally the base than persuade swing suburbanites. With Republicans defending most of their Senate seats in Trump territory, simply holding the president’s voters would be adequate to maintain Mitch McConnell’s majority. Here’s what I’m hearing from smart GOP strategists now: Republicans should be talking about their work to help their communities in the wake of the pandemic, and avoid referencing President Trump’s role in managing the crisis. To win battleground Senate seats that are looking more tenuous, it will be crucial to maintain support from some Trump-skeptical independents. If Trump’s political condition doesn’t improve by the fall, prepare to talk about keeping the Senate as a check against Democratic power, even if it means acknowledging the presidency is likely lost.”SENATE CAN’T COMPLY WITH BIDEN PROBE REQUESTFox News: “The secretary of the Senate on Monday said her office cannot comply with a request by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to order a search for a purported complaint made by the woman accusing him of sexual assault when he was a senator. … That statement from Biden tipped off confusion and speculation on wh","1596683732","1"

Mr. Trump said the task force would be shut down and replaced with an unspecified new advisory body as the country moved into what he called Phase 2 of a response to a pandemic that has killed more than 71,000 Americans. ‘We will have something in a different form,’ Mr. Trump told reporters as he toured a Honeywell mask manufacturing plant in Arizona, where he wore safety goggles but no mask. The president praised the work of the task force, led by Vice President Mike Pence, but said it was time to focus on safety and reopening the country. Mr. Pence said the group would probably wrap up its work around the end of the May, and shift management of the public health response back to the federal agencies whose work it was created to coordinate.”Grumbles abound - Fox News: “Democrats were quick to condemn the Trump administration Tuesday following comments from Vice President Mike Pence that the White House is in talks to potentially wind down its coronavirus task force, transferring its responsibilities to agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as early as Memorial Day or early June. An official told Fox News that the members of the task force will continue to provide input, but the group will not be meeting as regularly as they had been at the outset of the pandemic. The official added that the White House’s focus was shifting toward vaccines, therapeutics, testing and reopening the economy. The voices panning the Trump administration's decision to work on transferring the task force's responsibilities came from governors' offices, activists and some members of Congress.”Coronavirus on the march in rural America - AP: “As the world’s attention was fixated on the horrors in Italy and New York City, the per capita death rates in counties in the impoverished southwest corner of Georgia climbed to among the worst in the country. The devastation here is a cautionary tale of what happens when the virus seeps into communities that have for generations remained on the losing end of the nation’s most intractable inequalities: these counties are rural, mostly African American and poor. … Rural people, African Americans and the poor are more likely to work in jobs not conducive to social distancing, like the food processing plant in nearby Mitchell County where four employees died of COVID-19. They have less access to health care and so more often delay treatment for chronic conditions; in southwest Georgia, the diabetes rate of 16 percent is twice as high as in Atlanta. Transportation alone can be a challenge, so that by the time they make it to the hospital, they’re harder to save.”Tracking state trends - Axios: “In addition to keeping an eye on the tragic, and climbing, numbers of total coronavirus cases and deaths across the U.S., it's important to watch how those trends are playing out over time at the state level. … The Trump administration's reopening guidelines detail that in order to start lifting restrictions and reopening the economy, a state needs to report 14-day trends of fewer cases or fewer positive tests... Not a lot of states meet that criteria. Our chart compares each state's seven-day average of new cases from Monday and the seven-day average from a week prior, April 27. … By this metric, Minnesota, Nebraska and Puerto Rico have the most worrisome trends, while Arkansas and Wyoming have the most positive trends. Twelve states are moving in the right direction. But more than a third of the nation still has growing numbers of cases. And that includes states such as Texas and Virginia, where Republican and Democratic governors are beginning to unveil re-opening plans. These trends only tell us so much.”Chamber of Commerce offers a roadmap for businesses - U.S. News and World Report: “The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is providing guidance for America's business owners and employers to better understand their states' reopening procedures during the coronavirus pandemic. The Chamber released an interactive map on Wednesday detailing which states have started the process of reopening their economy and what rules non-essential businesses must follow in those states. … For each state, the Chamber includes information on general workplace guidance for businesses that are reopening, such as social distancing guidance, personal protective equipment requirements and accommodations that should be provided to vulnerable populations during the health crisis. Most states require 6feet of separation between customers, but some have additional requirements such as occupancy limits, which range from a 25% limit to a 50% limit to no limit, according to the Chamber's press release.”Pressure on president's son-in-law - NYT: “This spring, as the United States faced a critical shortage of masks, gloves and other protective equipment to battle the coronavirus pandemic, a South Carolina physician reached out to the Federal Emergency Management Agency with an offer of help. Dr. Jeffrey Hendricks had longtime manufacturing contacts in China and a line on millions of masks from established suppliers. Instead of encountering seasoned FEMA procurement officials, his information was diverted to a team of roughly a dozen young volunteers, recruited by the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and overseen by a former assistant to Mr. Kushner’s wife, Ivanka Trump. The volunteers, foot soldiers in the Trump administration’s new supply-chain task force, had little to no experience with government procurement procedures or medical equipment. But as part of Mr. Kushner’s governmentwide push to secure protective gear for the nation’s doctors and nurses, the volunteers were put in charge of sifting through more than a thousand incoming leads, and told to pass only the best ones on for further review by FEMA officials.”THE RULEBOOK: IF HE DOES SAY SO HIMSELF “I venture somewhat further, and hesitate not to affirm, that if the manner of [electing the president] be not perfect, it is at least excellent.

The Channel Tunnel, or ‘Chunnel,’ connects Folkestone, England, with Coquelles, France, 31 miles away. The Chunnel cut travel time between England and France to a swift 35 minutes and eventually between London and Paris to two-and-a-half hours. As the world’s longest undersea tunnel, the Chunnel runs under water for 23 miles, with an average depth of 150 feet below the seabed. Each day, about 30,000 people, 6,000 cars and 3,500 trucks journey through the Chunnel on passenger, shuttle and freight trains. … In 1996, the American Society of Civil Engineers identified the tunnel as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCEAverage approval: 44.6 percentAverage disapproval: 49.8 percentNet Score: -5.2 pointsChange from one week ago: ↑ 0.6 points[Average includes: Monmouth University: 44% approve - 51% disapprove; PRRI: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; IBD: 44% approve - 44% disapprove; Gallup: 49% approve - 47% disapprove; USA Today/Suffolk University: 43% approve - 53% disapprove.]  WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

The Monmouth University Poll finds that voters are divided on the credibility of a sexual assault allegation against the Democratic nominee. The poll also finds that former President Barack Obama is largely popular with the American electorate, 2020 voters are not as interested in considering a third party candidate as they were four years ago, and Democrats hold a lead in the generic House ballot. Also, half the nation’s voters are likely to consider voting by mail this November. Biden currently has the support of 50% of registered voters and Trump has the support of 41%. Another 3% say they would vote for an independent candidate and 5% are undecided. This represents a slightly wider lead for the Democrat than in previous Monmouth polls – 48% to 44% in April and 48% to 45% in March.”Biden faces continued pressure on veep pick - WaPo: “Joe Biden is under escalating pressure from competing branches of his party as he ponders the most consequential decision of his presidential candidacy: a running mate.

Sign up here.**PRESENTING YOUR PRESIDENTIAL POWER RANKINGSIn times of testing the rhythms of normal life can be a comfort, so let then the return of the Halftime Report Power Rankings be a comfort to you.We’re going to start our rankings for this election cycle with, what else, the Electoral College. We hope what you find below to be self-explanatory, but first a few notes for users.We have sorted the 50 states and the District of Columbia into five categories: Those states Democrat Joe Biden is likely to win, those states in which Biden has an advantage but the race is competitive, or there is a “lean,” those states that are pure toss ups, those states that are leaning toward President Trump but remain competitive and those states that are likely to vote for the incumbent.As you will see, there are more than enough electoral votes in the toss up category to put both sides within reach of victory. But you will also see that Democrats are starting with an advantage. Taken together “likely” and “lean” Democratic states account for 249 electoral votes, just 21 shy of the needed 270.Republicans open the bidding with 186 electoral votes on their side of the ledger, but that is typical of a party that tends to fare poorly in densely populated areas. Democrats can rely on behemoths like New York and California while Texas is the only reliably red state among those with 20 or more electoral votes. Every presidential election is a test of whether Republicans can bring enough medium sized swing states together to get the job done.We have ranked the states in the “toss up” category based on their competitiveness, that is to say in order of which states we think are the closest. The “lean” states are only listed by their number of electoral votes and the “likely” states are just by alphabetical order. You will find the most competitive states at the top of the note and the others below the fold.You will probably disagree with our judgement. That’s good! We rely on our readers to not only keep us honest in our assessments, but also to tell us what they are seeing and hearing in their own necks of the woods. Write to us and tell us what you think. Please remember that it’s early, very little polling has been done so far and the political consequences of an unprecedented shutdown make for a very volatile environment. We expect these rankings to change and change often.That’s all part of the fun.TOSS UPS(103 electoral votes)WISCONSIN10 electoral votes2016 results: Trump 47.2 percent, Clinton 46.5, others 6.3 percentPerhaps no state has been so narrowly divided for so long as Wisconsin. Big wins by Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 convinced Democrats that the Badger State was safe territory, but Obama’s winning coalition departed with him, putting the state back on a knife’s edge. George W. Bush missed here by less than half of a point in both of his runs and even a casual observer of state politics know that it’s ugly business. The recent brawl over holding an in-person primary election during the coronavirus lockdown was proof enough of that. Wisconsin looks to us like Trump’s best bet to hold on to one of the three “blue wall” states he flipped in 2016. It’s substantially whiter than Pennsylvania and Michigan and the Republican machine in the state is well oiled. Biden, though, sees plenty of promise. Clinton missed Obama’s 2012 number by nearly a quarter million votes – 10 times Trump’s margin of victory.OHIO18 electoral votes2016 result: Trump 51.3%, Clinton 43.2%, others 5.5%For the first time in more than two decades, the Buckeye State was not at the heart of the presidential battleground map in 2016. Donald Trump opened up a lead coming out of his nomination at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and never looked back. Trump went on to rack up an 8-point victory, the largest victory margin by a presidential candidate in Ohio since George H.W. Bush in 1988. But now, like Bush, Trump is facing a potential reversal in Ohio as an incumbent. Democrats on the state and federal level have shown strongly in the past four years, particularly pro-union Sen. Sherrod Brown. The key battleground between Trump and Joe Biden will be the state’s northern tier, home to eight of the nine counties that went from red to blue from 2012 to 2016. Voters who live around Toledo and Cleveland, your break is over. It’s back to being at the center of the storm.FLORIDA29 electoral votes2016 result: Trump 48.6%, Clinton 47.4%, others 4%With a massive cache of 29 electoral votes and a long history of excruciatingly close elections, including the hanging chads of 2000, the Sunshine State is the king of the swing states. Since George W. Bush’s 537-vote victory 20 years ago, the state has split evenly for Republican and Democratic presidential candidates. The past two elections were both decided by less than 2 points. In 2016, it looked for a time like Donald Trump might be on his way to a big (by Florida standards) win, but the race closed at the end and finished as a nail-biter. Since then, Republicans have prospered in Florida, with statewide wins for Senate and Governor despite headwinds in 2018. But 2020 promises a return of the old Florida model in which the Democratic strongholds of the south match up with Republican districts to the north with the prime battle zone along the I-4 corridor through Tampa and Orlando.ARIZONA11 electoral votes2016 result: Trump 48.1%, Clinton 44.6%, others 7.3%Arizona has about as much experience with swing-state politics as it does with blizzards, but it’s time to start shoveling. In the past 70 years, just one Democrat has carried the Grand Canyon State: Bill Clinton nipped Bob Dole in Clinton’s 1996 re-elect. Otherwise, Barry Goldwater’s home state has been a bastion for not just Republicans, but conservatism. Trump’s comparatively weak performance in 2016 is owed to several factors, including the decision by many traditional conservatives to vote for a third party or sit out the race in protest of Trump’s candidacy. But the main driver of political change in the state has been the influx of Americans from other states into Arizona. With a growing economy and an attractive climate for retirees, the state’s population has increased by 50 percent since the turn of the century. Over the same period, the state’s Hispanic population increased from 25 percent to 31 percent.PENNSYLVANIA20 electoral votes2016 election result: Trump 48.2%, Clinton 47.5%, other 4.3%There are a lot of ways to explain how Democrats settled on Biden for their nominee, but none of them is as clear as Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes. A native of Scranton in the state’s industrial east, Biden typifies the traditional Democratic politics of the state: moderation, blue-collar appeal and a folksy style. Hillary Clinton’s loss in big, blue Pennsylvania was a low point for the modern Democratic Party, one they believe Biden will reverse. But Trump is not without advantages. Those same voters who had supported Democrats like Biden in the past show a strong affinity for the incumbent. The reality may be that Democrats have lost places like Wilkes-Barre and Scranton and will have to make up the difference elsewhere. Key battlegrounds will be in the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh suburbs where Republicans must stop their ongoing losses and in urban centers where Democrats must energize African-American voters who were cool on Clinton.NORTH CAROLINA15 electoral votes2016 election result: Trump 49.8%, Clinton 46.2%, other 4%The Tar Heel state was part of the Solid South for Republicans for 40 years until Barack Obama’s narrow win in 2008. Republicans brought the state back with small margins in the next two contests, but North Carolina is back in play in a big way. With a Democratic governor, a competitive race for freshman Sen. Thom Tillis’ seat and rough parity in voter registrations, Carolina Blue looks very possible. Like Obama before him, Trump is going to be re-nominated in Charlotte, but hopes to avoid Obama’s fate in November here. Charlotte matters bigly. Its county, Mecklenburg, was a rare bright spot for Hillary Clinton, who outperformed Obama in the Queen City’s suburbs. If Biden can expand her edge with the state’s large number of affluent voters and reverse some of her slide with black turnout, this will get to be a close race very quickly.THE RULEBOOK: AIN’T THAT THE TRUTH“Man is very much a creature of habit. A thing that rarely strikes his senses will generally have but little influence upon his mind.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 27TIME OUT: CHEERS, MARJORIE BBC: “Standing in the packed streets of Versailles, France, 75 years ago, Marjorie Morgan celebrated VE Day. Just hours before, she had driven an Allied general to Reims, and stood outside as a German general signed the unconditional surrender to end World War Two in Europe. ‘To me it was just a job, it was something you think about afterwards,’ she said. While the 98-year-old believes there was nothing remarkable about her role during the war, hers is one of the many incredible stories of sacrifice made by people from communities across Wales all those years ago. Today, like others who remember that time, Marjorie will celebrate the anniversary of VE Day on a much smaller scale… Marjorie, like thousands of women, joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS), the women's branch of the British Army during the war effort. After spending years as an army driving instructor, by 1945 she was driving generals, and ended up driving to the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) in Reims, where General Alfred Jodl, German Chief of Operations, signed the unconditional surrender.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD Average approval: 45.2 percentAverage disapproval: 50 percentNet Score: -4.8 pointsChange from one week ago: no change in points[Average includes: CNBC: 46% approve - 54% disapprove; Monmouth University: 44% approve - 51% disapprove; PRRI: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; IBD: 44% approve - 44% disapprove; Gallup: 49% approve - 47% disapprove.]  WANT MORE HALFT","1601349903","1"

"5767","A patent-pending system worn under face masks to sanitize the air and neutralize live viruses such as COVID-19 through ultraviolet light exposure may soon be available from a company called Oracle Lighting.","1606913382","1"
"5768","The new “Antimicrobial Irradiation Respirator,” or AIR device, is said to protect against the 5 percent of particulate that manages to get past N95 masks, according to a company statement.","1606913382","1"
"5769","      Oracle Lighting has developed a virus neutralizing, UV face mask for consumer and medical use. ","1606913382","1"
"5770","“Consumers need better assurance to be confident that they will not be exposed [to COVID-19],” said Justin Hartenstein, Oracle Lighting director of product development, in the company statement. “The AIR device will neutralize that remaining five percent while sanitizing the contaminated mask at the same time. Studies have shown that respiratory pathogens on the outer surface of cloth masks can actually result in self-contamination, which is exactly what they are intended to prevent. Because of this, we see the unique UV irritation benefits of the AIR device as the best sanitization scenario for mitigating exposure to COVID-19 and other viruses.”","1606913382","1"
"5771","According to Oracle Lighting, existing personal air filtration masks are designed to prevent the inhalation of viruses by trapping the particles from the incoming air in the cloth material worn on the face. However, they are not designed to disinfect or sanitize the particles. Masks can then become saturated with live viruses, pathogens, bacterium or other microorganisms attached to the fabric surfaces.","1606913382","1"
"5772","Health officials, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have advised laundering face masks. In fact, the CDC specifically wrote, “a washing machine should suffice in properly washing a cloth face covering.”","1606913382","1"
"5773","“The AIR device is composed of a small cover made of an anti-microbial polymer which is worn on the face and attached with straps similar to a traditional face mask,” Hartenstein said. “The user wears a traditional face mask (cloth mask, surgical mask, N95, etc.) over the device. A small rechargeable battery pack powers the device and can be manually turned on and off by the user. In addition to the anti-germicidal LEDs, the device also contains UV-A LEDs which provide a wider light spectrum and visible light. The visible UV-A LED functions as an indicator that the device is on and working but provides minimal anti-microbial benefits.”","1606913382","1"
"5774","“UV-C light has been used in many applications such as the purification of drinking water for decades,” Hartenstein said. “While UV-C is part of the normal spectrum of sunlight, it is invisible and can cause sunburn with direct skin exposure. This was taken into account when developing the AIR and so the UV light is directed into the mask, away from the user, to prevent any direct skin exposure.”","1606913382","1"

"5779","Many forms of ventilation use masks to help get oxygen into the lungs.

Patients are heavily sedated, to stop their respiratory muscles from fighting the machine.","1607030374","1"
"5780","Instead of putting Bergmann on a mechanical ventilator, the clinic gave him morphine and kept him on the oxygen mask. He’s since tested free of the infection, but not fully recovered.

Doctors including Voshaar worry about the risk that ventilators will damage patients’ lungs.","1607030374","1"

Kendall, a 30-something executive of the Pepsi-Cola Company, poured a fateful cup of cold Pepsi. The recipient, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, had just been engaged in the infamous ‘Kitchen Debate’ with the visiting U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon. Hoping this pour would prove worthwhile, Kendall’s business acumen would cement the Soviet Union’s love for the beverage… At the Moscow event, Americans showcased cars, dishwashers, televisions, and, at Kendall’s booth, Pepsi soda. Kendall, a friend of Nixon’s, told The New York Times, ‘I went to Nixon the night before, at the embassy, and told him I was in a lot of trouble at home because people thought I was wasting Pepsi’s money coming to a Communist country.’ Kendall knew he ‘had to get a Pepsi in Khrushchev’s hand.’ Nixon made it happen.

Mr. Pompeo chose instead to answer written questions from investigators working for the inspector general, Steve A. Linick, who was fired by President Trump on Friday. That indicates that the secretary of state was aware of Mr. Linick’s investigation and the specific lines of questioning about Mr. Pompeo’s decision last year to resume the sales of bombs and other weapons, which had been stalled since 2017.

The State Department inspector general, Steve Linick, was looking into the role of Toni Porter, Pompeo’s senior adviser, and whether she as a political appointee was conducting Pompeo’s personal business on government time, two sources said. Porter did not register a complaint herself to the inspector general. Rather, the investigation into her role was triggered by multiple complaints on the IG hotline, one of the sources said.”Pompeo denies wrongdoing, sorry he didn’t fire I.G. sooner - NYT: “Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday defended his recommendation to fire the State Department’s inspector general, saying he should have done it sooner.

The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee appeared on the Breakfast Club, a radio program that is widely regarded in the black community. The host, Charlamagne Tha God, pressed Biden on reports that he is considering Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is white, to be vice president… [Biden] then added: ‘If you’ve got a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or for Trump, then you ain’t black.’ … Symone Sanders, a Biden senior adviser who is also black, said his comment in Friday’s interview was ‘made in jest.’ ‘Let’s be clear about what the VP was saying,’ Sanders tweeted. ‘He was making the distinction that he would put his record with the African American community up against Trump’s any day. Period.’”Radio host says he wants results, not talk from Biden - Mediaite: “Charlamagne replied, ‘It don’t have nothing to do with Trump. It has to do with the fact that I want something for my community.’ Biden said his record in that area was ‘second to none.’ In a statement to Mediaite, Charlamagne said his response stood on its own. ‘We have been loyal to Democrats for a long time, black people have invested a lot into that party and the return on investment has not been great,’ he wrote. ‘As Biden said in our brief interview when I asked him if Dems owe the black community ABSOLUTELY was his answer. So let’s see what you got!!! Votes are Quid Pro Quo. You can’t possibly want me to Fear Trump MORE than I want something for my people.’”Trump campaign calls Biden’s line ‘dehumanizing’ - Bloomberg: “‘It is clear now more than ever, following these racist and dehumanizing remarks, that Joe Biden believes black men and women are incapable of being independent or free thinking,’ Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign senior adviser, said in a statement issued by ‘Black Voices for Trump.’ ‘Frankly I would love to have a policy contrast with Joe Biden and President Trump on the things that we’ve been able to accomplish,’ [South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott] said in a conference call he and Pierson held with reporters. On Thursday, during a visit to a Ford plant that makes ventilators, Trump praised Henry Ford, who was openly racist and anti-Semitic. Trump said Ford has ‘good bloodlines, good bloodlines, if you believe in that stuff.’”Bernie backers not opening wallets for Biden - WSJ: Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has yet to unlock a key part of the party’s fundraising base less than six months before Election Day: Bernie Sanders’s army of online small donors, a Wall Street Journal analysis found. About 60,000 people who gave to the Vermont senator during the Democratic primary had also chipped in to Mr. Biden’s campaign by the end of April, according to the Journal’s analysis of Federal Election Commission data filed this week. That group amounted to just under 3% of the roughly 2.2 million total Sanders donors the Journal identified in public filings.”Reade’s work as expert witness called into doubt - NYT: “Defense lawyers in California are reviewing criminal cases in which Tara Reade, the former Senate aide who has accused Joseph R. Biden Jr. of sexual assault, served as an expert witness on domestic violence, concerned that she misrepresented her educational credentials in court. Then known as Alexandra McCabe, Ms. Reade testified as a government witness in Monterey County courts for nearly a decade, describing herself as an expert in the dynamics of domestic violence who had counseled hundreds of victims. But lawyers who had faced off against her in court began raising questions about the legitimacy of her testimony, and the verdicts that followed, after news reports this week that Antioch University had disputed her claim of receiving a bachelor’s degree from its Seattle campus.”Lawyer drops - NY Post: “Joe Biden sex assault accuser Tara Reade and her lawyer have parted ways. Attorney Douglas Wigdor announced the split Friday just weeks after Reade, a former Senate staffer of Biden’s, hired the high-profile sex-harassment lawyer. In a statement, the Manhattan litigator did not provide a reason for the decision but said it had nothing to do with the veracity of Reade’s claims that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Biden assaulted her in the 1990s. ‘Our firm no longer represents Tara Reade. Our decision, made on May 20, is by no means a reflection on whether then-Senator Biden sexually assaulted Ms. Reade,’ Wigdor wrote before defending his former client’s poor treatment in the media.”THE RULEBOOK: MORE MONEY, MORE PROBLEMS“The importance of commerce, in the view of revenue alone, must effectually guard it against the enmity of a body which would be continually importuned in its favor, by the urgent calls of public necessity.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 60TIME OUT: IN MEMORIUMIf the United States of America was the beneficiary of the most advantaged birth of any nation in history, our passage into adulthood more than made up for it in terms of suffering.Monday is Memorial Day, an opportunity to decorate the graves and remember all those who laid down their lives in defense of this nation, “the last best hope of earth.” It is our duty and privilege as the beneficiaries of their sacrifices.But the observance began with the memory of the Civil War dead, first among the widows of Confederate soldiers and then taken up by the survivors of the Union side. Initially known as Decoration Day, the holiday came into its current form in 1971.The first 85 years of our national history was a breathless sprint forward. Our meager forces twice defeated the most powerful empire in the world with minimal casualties, the size of the new nation had more than tripled and our wealth was multiplying even faster. The race was on.But the unfinished work of our founding – the elimination of slavery – would stop that sprint. What Americans North and South could not know in 1861 was just how painful completing that task would be.The scope of the slaughter and magnitude of the loss defies even the understanding of the Americans who endured in the great wars of the 20th century. To try to grasp the scale, imagine if almost 8 million Americans today had been killed in a war.But numbers will not answer in a matter like this one. So, we turn to poetry.Herman Melville was deeply affected by the war, which had drawn in so many of his friends and relatives.  He, too old by then for service, visited the front himself and saw the carnage firsthand.The battle of Shiloh in April 1862 was the first battle to reveal the magnitude of the horrors to come. A Confederate ambush led to an eventual Union victory that claimed nearly 24,000 dead and wounded in less than two days. The terrible, ravening beast of modern warfare had been loosed on our land.The story of a frontier church where the casualties from both sides lay dying stirred Melville:Shiloh: A RequiemSkimming lightly, wheeling still,The swallows fly lowOver the field in clouded days,The forest-field of Shiloh—Over the field where April rainSolaced the parched ones stretched in painThrough the pause of nightThat followed the Sunday fightAround the church of Shiloh—The church so lone, the log-built one,That echoed to many a parting groanAnd natural prayerOf dying foemen mingled there—Foemen at morn, but friends at eve—Fame or country least their care:(What like a bullet can undeceive!)But now they lie low,While over them the swallows skim,And all is hushed at Shiloh.[Ed. note: Halftime Report will not be published on Monday in observance of Memorial Day.]Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD PRESIDENTIAL POWER RANKINGS(270 electoral votes needed to win)Toss-up: (103 electoral votes): Wisconsin (10), Ohio (18), Florida (29), Arizona (11), Pennsylvania (20), North Carolina (15)Lean R/Likely R: (186 electoral votes) Lean D/Likely D: (249 electoral votes)[Full rankings here.]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCEAverage approval: 44.2 percentAverage disapproval: 52.6 percentNet Score: -8.4 pointsChange from one week ago: ↑ 0.2 points  [Average includes: American Research Group: 40% approve - 57% disapprove; Fox News: 44% approve - 54% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 42% approve - 53% disapprove; CNN: 46% approve - 51% disapprove; Gallup: 49% approve - 48% disapprove.] WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

The latest Fox News Poll finds voters trust Biden to do a better job than Trump on health care by 17 points, coronavirus by 9, and relations with China by 6. Trump is trusted more on the economy by a slim 3-point margin. … Eighty-eight percent are concerned about coronavirus spreading and 78 percent feel the economy is in bad shape. There has been a seismic shift in views on the economy since the pandemic. In January, voters rated economic conditions positively by an 11-point margin… Today, views are negative by 58 points:  20 percent excellent/good vs. 78 percent only fair/poor. … In the 2020 ballot test, Biden leads Trump by 48-40 percent. … However, given that 11 percent are undecided or plan to vote for someone else, neither candidate hits 50 percent support.

"6132","“Maskne,” or acne that tends to form around the areas of your face covered by protective masks, is becoming more and more common as Americans don protective face coverings in the fight against COVID-19. But that doesn’t mean you have to accept “maskne” as just another irritating facet of life in 2020.","1616767882","1"
"6133","Dr. Samer Jaber, of Washington Square Dermatology in NYC, says that while “maskne” may be more prevalent, there’s no reason not to adopt a few simple practices to keep it from forming in the first place.","1616767882","1"
"6134","“When you wear a mask, you seal in your breath,” says Dr. Jaber on the causes of “maskne” and other related skin conditions. “This creates a moist, humid environment as it traps your breath, skin oils and sweat, leading to irritation, rashes and acne.”","1616767882","1"
"6135","Comparing the phenomenon to diaper rash, Jaber adds that the masks themselves may also irritate skin simply by being in contact with the face for long periods of time. This can possibly exacerbate existing conditions like eczema, psoriasis or rosacea.","1616767882","1"
"6136","      Protective face masks prevent the spread of COVID-19, but they're not preventing breakouts or facial acne, many users say.","1616767882","1"
"6137","“The longer you wear a mask the worse it is, so this is unfortunately very common in health care workers, as they need to wear their masks for long periods of time,” says Dr. Jaber.","1616767882","1"
"6138","Masks, meanwhile, are recommended for those who can’t sufficiently social-distance themselves in public settings, and are outright required of the public by some travel providers, retail operators and now at major theme parks. But while masks can be a nuisance, they are sometimes necessary to prevent infecting others. When safely self-isolating, though, Jaber recommends you free up your face.","1616767882","1"
"6139","“If you can safely take off your mask, then take off your mask and let your skin breathe when possible,” Jaber says.","1616767882","1"
"6140","There are a number of other precautions the mask-wearing public should be taking to prevent “maskne,” Jaber recommends washing the face twice daily, with whatever cleanser works best for your skin type, and following with a moisturizer around the areas where the mask usually irritates the skin.","1616767882","1"
"6141","      “If you can safely take off your mask, then take off your mask and let your skin breathe when possible,” says Dr. Samer Jaber of Washington Square Dermatology in NYC.","1616767882","1"
"6142","It’s also imperative to let your masks dry out after each wear, and to wash your cloth face coverings regularly “to remove the oils and sweat trapped in it,” Jaber explains.","1616767882","1"
"6143","If things are especially bad, Jaber has one last recommendation: “Don’t wear makeup under your mask.”","1616767882","1"

GOVERNORWaPo: “President Trump threatened on Monday to move the Republican National Convention out of North Carolina — while denying that he wants to hold the convention at his namesake resort in Florida even as some state officials started clamoring for the president’s adopted home state to be the venue. Accusing North Carolina’s Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, of being in a ‘shutdown mood,’ Trump — in a string of early-morning Memorial Day tweets — pressured Cooper to guarantee that ‘we will be allowed full attendance in the Arena’ in Charlotte by the late-August convention. … The threat singling out a Democratic governor who has followed federal guidelines echoed Trump’s pressure on other Democratic-led states to reopen as the coronavirus pandemic pushes the economy to the worst crisis since the Great Depression, with approximately 38 million Americans filing for unemployment and scores of businesses shuttering. Trump, who sees a revived economy as critical to his reelection, also has encouraged protests against Democratic governors who have imposed stay-at-home orders consistent with federal health officials’ recommendations.”Florida volunteers as backup - Miami Herald: “Florida Republicans said they would ‘welcome’ the Republican National Convention if President Donald Trump makes good on a Twitter threat Monday to pull the party’s seminal political event from North Carolina. ‘The Republican Party of Florida would welcome the opportunity to host the Republican National Convention,’ party Chairman Joe Gruters said in a statement. ‘Florida is committed to ensuring a safe, secure and successful event for President Trump and all attendees.’ The Republican National Committee has been planning to host its nominating convention at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte from Aug. 24-27.”Trump beefs up campaign staff after setbacks - NYT: “President Trump’s aides are promoting one of his top political advisers to deputy campaign manager, in a move to bolster the team heading into the final five months of the re-election effort, officials said on Tuesday. Bill Stepien, the former White House political director who has been working as a senior political adviser to the campaign, said in a statement that the new role will let him support both Mr. Trump and the campaign manager, Brad Parscale. ‘I will continue to support Brad Parscale as he leads the campaign, working with all of our partners in states across the country, and helping to coordinate all of our efforts to ensure the president is re-elected,’ Mr. Stepien said. The campaign is also promoting Stephanie Alexander, currently the Midwest regional political director, to the campaign chief of staff.”Trump continues to lay groundwork for fraud claims - Politico: “First he lit into Michigan and Nevada, threatening to withhold federal funding because of his assertion that both states were preparing to commit voter fraud through mail-in ballot applications. Then President Donald Trump followed up Sunday with two more broadly worded warnings that November would be ‘the greatest Rigged Election in history.’ ‘The Democrats are trying to Rig the 2020 Election, plain and simple!’ the president claimed. Trump’s increasingly amped-up rhetoric surrounding the integrity of the November election is beginning to bring to center stage a previously muted conversation. With the president lagging behind Joe Biden in public opinion polls six months before the general election, his opponents are becoming increasingly anxious that Trump may attempt to undermine the results of the election if he loses — or worse, might attempt to cling to power regardless of the outcome.”Biden comes out from lockdown for Memorial Day wreath laying - Bloomberg: “Joe Biden emerged Monday from his stay-at-home lockdown after more than 10 weeks to mark Memorial Day with a tribute to veterans. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and his wife, Jill, visited the Veterans Memorial Park at the Delaware Memorial Bridge to lay a wreath of white roses. Both wore black masks over their mouths and noses. Biden’s wearing of personal protective gear stood in contrast to President Donald Trump, who has made a show of flouting local standards by skipping a mask at events outside the White House. The visit was Biden’s first public trip since he said he would abide by the state’s coronavirus rules and the advice of health experts. He and his wife placed a wreath of white roses and stood solemnly for a moment or two of silence before walking back toward their car. ‘It feels good to be out of my house,’ he told reporters.”Whitmer’s husband caught in corona controversy - The Detroit News: “The owner of a Northern Michigan dock company says Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's husband wanted his boat placed in the water before the Memorial Day weekend as Whitmer urged residents not to rush to the region.

The posts have drawn the attention of Republican state lawmakers, who said the Democratic governor's family may not be following her guidance for the rest of the state. Whitmer's spokeswoman, Tiffany Brown, didn't confirm or deny Monday the assertions by the marina company or its owner. Brown said the administration wouldn't address ‘every rumor that is spread online.’”Biden’s got the advantage in Minnesota poll - The [Minneapolis] Star Tribune: “Former Vice President Joe Biden holds a small lead over President Donald Trump among registered voters in Minnesota, according to the first presidential poll in the state since the Democrat clinched his party’s nomination. A new Minnesota Poll conducted by the Star Tribune, MPR News and KARE 11 found Biden ahead of Trump 49% to 44% in the general election matchup less than six months ahead of Election Day. Biden fell just short of a majority, but 7% of Minnesotans said they are still undecided. The poll also found that statewide, 53% of voters disapprove of the Republican incumbent’s job performance as president, compared with 45% who approve. Only 2% were undecided about Trump, reflecting a high degree of polarization heading into the fall election season.”SESSIONS SASSESAL.com: “A Twitter battle between President Donald Trump and his former attorney general spilled into Saturday, with Jeff Sessions defending his support among conservatives and the president later on Sessions to withdraw from the Alabama senate race. Trump, in his Saturday evening tweet, called on Sessions to drop out of the race for Senate and ‘pray’ that Democratic U.S. Senator Doug Jones loses in November. … Sessions, late Saturday, said he will ‘never apologize for following the law’ and defended his decision in 2017 to recuse himself from the U.S. Department of Justice’s investigation into Russia’s interference into the 2016 presidential election. … Sessions, in the Friday night Tweet, told Trump he did his duty and ‘you’re damn fortunate I did. I protected the rule of law & resulted in your exoneration.’ Sessions responded after Trump tweeted earlier on Friday his support for [Tommy] Tuberville.”King’s primary challenger eschews bigotry claims - AP: “Rep. Steve King is fighting for his political life — but not because he’s compared immigrants crossing the border illegally to cattle. His Republican opponents in next week’s primary aren’t raking him over the coals for making light of rape and incest. His chief rival’s ads don’t mention the time he wondered when the term ‘white supremacist’ became offensive. Instead, the nine-term congressman known for his nativist politics is fighting to prove he can still deliver for Iowa’s 4th Congressional District. Since Republican leaders stripped him of his committee assignments, in a rare punishment, King has been dogged by questions over whether he’s lost all effectiveness. Some longtime supporters are turning away, not because of his incendiary remarks but because they think he can no longer do the job.”House Dems spend $18.3 million for fall TV ads - Roll Call: “With less than six months before Election Day, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has reserved more than $18.3 million in airtime for broadcast television ads during the final months of the campaign. It’s likely the first of multiple rounds of reservations, considering the committee’s independent expenditure arm spent more than $73 million on TV during the 2018 cycle. This initial round of reservations overlap with the Senate and presidential battleground states, including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada and Pennsylvania, where media markets are likely to get crowded and expensive. Back in April, the two biggest partisan super PACs — the GOP-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund ($51 million) and Democratic-aligned House Majority PAC ($43 million) — placed nearly $100 million combined in initial ad reservations.

They’ve asked a lot of questions.’ … Biden said he’s looking for someone he is comfortable with, as opposed to an ideological ally.”Greenberg still likes Warren - Politico: “Stan Greenberg, one of the Democratic Party's longtime leading pollsters, urged Hillary Clinton in 2016 to pick Elizabeth Warren as her vice president. He thinks Clinton would be president had she listened. Now Greenberg — who popularized the term ‘Reagan Democrats’ and came to prominence as Bill Clinton’s lead pollster — is urging Joe Biden’s team to heed the same advice. Earlier this month, he briefed top Biden campaign officials on two battleground surveys conducted by his firm. Accompanied by a slide presentation that was obtained by POLITICO, Greenberg addressed the question hanging over Biden and his inner circle: Which vice presidential candidate will help the most in November? The conclusion was blunt: ‘Sen. Warren is the obvious solution.’ Biden’s biggest problem, Greenberg said, is that the Democratic Party has not unified behind him.African-American activists dig in against Klobuchar - Fox News: “African-American activists are escalating their efforts to persuade former Vice President Joe Biden not to name Sen. Amy Klobuchar as his running mate, arguing he needs to choose someone who would excite black voters. Those efforts come amid the national spotlight on the case of a black man in Minnesota who died on Monday after being pinned to the ground by a Minneapolis police officer who had his knee to man’s neck. That situation appears to be turning up the volume on calls for Biden not to choose Klobuchar. Klobuchar – the Minnesota senator who didn't resonate with black voters during her bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination – was already being criticized by activists as a choice that would not motivate black voters to support Biden in November’s general election. African-Americans are a key part of the Democratic Party’s base.”Biden builds out campaign - WaPo: “Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has hired two aides to helm a new coalitions department modeled on President Barack Obama’s reelection strategy, a campaign expansion that adds more racial diversity to his effort to win the White House. Ashley Allison, a veteran of the Obama White House who is African American, is joining the Biden campaign as national coalitions director. Her deputy will be Jason Rodriguez, who served as the national deputy Latino vote director for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and has worked with the Congressional Black Caucus. The moves come amid a broader expansion of the Biden campaign, which included a doubling of his digital staff and new hires in fundraising and organizing. Staffing up will continue and will increase significantly in June, according to Biden’s campaign manager, Jen O’Malley Dillon.”Biden to participate in Texas' virtual-convention - Axios: “Joe Biden will help close out the Texas Democratic Party's all-virtual convention next week as one of the event’s major speakers. The coronavirus is changing conventions as we know them. Given Texas' size, the event could serve as a test run of sorts for large-scale virtual events, as planners consider whether at least some aspects of the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee in August should be virtual. The Texas Democratic Party has been in contact with the Democratic National Convention throughout their planning process, a party official said, sharing best practices on how to host an online event of this size. To avoid any technical difficulties, speakers are pre-recording their videos for the convention, which will play throughout the nine-hour livestream on June 1. Biden is expected to address the importance of turning Texas blue and Texas' status as a battleground state in his video. Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke will also join as a featured speaker.”New anti-Trump GOP group set to spend $10 million - NYT: “…[A] new effort called Republican Voters Against Trump is hoping to chip away at Mr. Trump’s support from white, college-educated Republican voters in the suburbs, hoping a more surgical approach will help to elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., his expected Democratic opponent. The new group is set to begin a $10 million digital and television advertising campaign that will use personal stories of conservative voters giving voice to their deep — and sometimes brand-new — dissatisfaction with the president. The group will test the premise of whether there are really any persuadable voters left in a deeply tribal moment in American politics, in which views of Mr. Trump, both positive and negative, have only been hardened over the past four years.”BADGER STATE CLOSE TO DEAL ON MAIL-IN RULESMilwaukee Journal Sentinel: “Wisconsin election officials agreed Wednesday to send absentee ballot applications to most voters this fall, but the plan could face obstacles next month if Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on the wording of the mailing. The members of the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission voted 6-0 to advance the plan a week after they failed to reach consensus on who should receive ballot applications. Under the commission's plan, the state will not send actual absentee ballots, but rather the forms voters can use to request them. If voters filled out those forms and provided a copy of a photo ID, they would receive an absentee ballot for the Nov. 3 presidential election.”Texas digs in against corona absentee ballots - Texas Tribune: “The Texas Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a lack of immunity to the new coronavirus does not qualify a voter to apply for a mail-in ballot. In the latest twist in the legal fight over voting by mail during the coronavirus pandemic, the court agreed with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton that the risk of contracting the virus alone does not meet the state’s qualifications for voting by mail. ‘We agree with the State that a voter’s lack of immunity to COVID-19, without more, is not a ‘disability’ as defined by the Election Code,’ the court wrote. Texas voters can qualify for mail-in ballots only if they are 65 years or older, have a disability or illness, will be out of the county during the election period, or are confined in jail. The Texas election code defines disability as a ‘sickness or physical condition’ that prevents a voter from appearing in person without the risk of ‘injuring the voter’s health.’”ANTI-TERROR MEASURES IN DOUBT AFTER BREAKDOWNFox News: “House Democrats scrapped plans to vote on a bipartisan bill to reauthorize national security surveillance tools after President Trump issued a veto threat on Twitter Wednesday night. Democrats had already postponed a vote slated for Wednesday because of earlier objections from the president, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer officially pulled the bill from consideration Thursday morning when it became clear that House Republicans would no longer back the bill. ‘The President tweeted that he would veto the bill, and House Republicans abandoned their support for our national security,’ Pelosi said a statement Thursday after Hoyer announced the vote was off. The planned vote was to reauthorize Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) provisions and enact more reforms to safeguard civil liberties. The House was to take up the Senate measure that passed 80-16 to reauthorize lapsed provisions and revise how the Justice Department and FBI use the tools designed to fight terrorism.”Compromise talks on business loan terms continue - Roll Call: “A Republican lawmaker said Wednesday that negotiators agreed to adjust a key ratio in a program to relieve small businesses from the COVID-19 pandemic, lowering to 60 percent the portion of loans that must be used for payroll, from 75 percent currently, and giving borrowers more time to use any loans. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, the sponsor of a bill that is scheduled for a House floor vote Thursday, told CQ Roll Call that he expects House and Senate leaders to reach a deal on how small businesses can use a $660 billion lifeline provided in two previous economic relief laws through the Paycheck Protection Program administered by the Small Business Administration.  … The bill would reduce an administration requirement that 75 percent of PPP loan funds be used for payroll.”JOBLESS CLAIMS TOP 40 MILLION IN 10 WEEKSPolitico: “Workers filed 2.1 million new unemployment claims last week, the Department of Labor reported, suggesting about a quarter of the workforce is seeking jobless aid to weather the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus. The latest figure indicates that the pandemic has pushed 40.8 million Americans out of work in just 10 weeks. DOL also reported that another 1.2 million people applied for benefits under the new temporary Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program created for individuals who are typically ineligible for unemployment insurance, such as self-employed workers. With those people added, the raw unadjusted number of claims filed last week could be as high as 3.1 million, though there could be some overlap between the new program and tradit","1619358078","1"

Blind and deaf from infancy, Keller circumvented her disabilities to become a world-renowned writer and lecturer. … Keller [was] an accomplished writer, publishing, among other books, The World I Live In (1908), Out of the Dark (1913), My Religion (1927), Helen Keller’s Journal (1938), and Teacher (1955).

Her lecture tours took her several times around the world, and she did much to remove the stigmas and ignorance surrounding sight and hearing disorders, which historically had often resulted in the committal of the blind and deaf to asylums. Helen Keller was also outspoken in other areas and supported socialism all her life.

Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference with law enforcement and national security officials, telling the local leaders they ‘have to get much tougher’ amid nationwide protests and criticizing their responses. ‘Most of you are weak,’ Trump said. ‘You have to arrest people.’ … The president urged the governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited for helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis. He demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced a spasm of violence, like New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. ‘You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again,’ said Trump. ‘We’re doing it in Washington, D.C. We’re going to do something that people haven’t seen before.’”Trump waited out riot in bunker - NYT: “Inside the White House, the mood was bristling with tension. Hundreds of protesters were gathering outside the gates, shouting curses at President Trump and in some cases throwing bricks and bottles. Nervous for his safety, Secret Service agents abruptly rushed the president to the underground bunker used in the past during terrorist attacks. … After days in which the empathy he expressed for George Floyd, the man killed, was overshadowed by his combative threats to ramp up violence against looters and rioters, Mr. Trump spent Sunday out of sight, even as some of his campaign advisers were recommending that he deliver a nationally televised address before another night of violence. The building was even emptier than usual as some White House officials planning to work were told not to come in case of renewed unrest.”Biden heads to black church for meeting on killings, riots - AP: “Joe Biden vowed to address ‘institutional racism’ in his first 100 days in office as he met with community leaders at a predominantly African American church in Delaware Monday morning, leaving home for a second consecutive day to address exploding racial tensions that have begun to reshape the upcoming presidential election. … But after another night of violent protests, the 77-year-old Democrat gathered with roughly a dozen local black leaders during an intimate meeting in his hometown ahead of a virtual meeting with mayors from Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago and St. Paul, Minnesota. ‘Hate just hides. It doesn't go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,’ Biden said, his face mask lowered around his chin, after several participants shared their thoughts on police brutality.

But they ultimately calculated this wasn’t a good idea, because he didn’t have anything new to say or announce. … The extraordinary vacuum of leadership this has created gives Joe Biden a big opening. But how will he use it? Biden advisers tell me we can expect a few things. First, they say, we can expect Biden to place more emphasis in coming days on the need for more expansive use of the Justice Department to crack down on systemic police department racism and abuses. … Second, they say, we can expect more of an effort from Biden to speak to the nation in the manner he believes a president should do at a moment like this. … After talking to the Biden campaign, I’m persuaded that they reject this fundamental premise, though they may not prove willing to go as far in proposing reform as some might want.”BIDEN CLOSING IN ON MAGIC NUMBERFox News: “The former vice president currently has 1,566 delegates to [Bernie] Sanders' 1,007. Biden needs 425 more delegates to secure the 1,991 majority of delegates needed to win the nomination, a total he can theoretically secure on Tuesday. Among the seven states that vote in the Democratic presidential primary Tuesday – Iowa, which holds the first-in-the-nation caucuses, is holding its primary for non-presidential offices – there are 479 delegates available. Biden, the only game in town, could theoretically lace up the Democratic nomination if he gets 425 or more of those delegates. But voters can still select candidates besides Biden on their ballots, and Sanders has previously said he still hopes to amass delegates in the later primaries in a bid to gain influence at the Democratic convention later this year.”Other races to watch Tuesday - USA Today: “The primary in Iowa's 4th Congressional District will determine whether Republican voters in this largely rural district spanning northwest Iowa return Rep. Steve King to office. … Iowa has a competitive Democratic primary for the nomination to take on Republican incumbent Sen. Joni Ernst. … Ernst's seat is seen by some analysts as a pick-up opportunity for Democrats looking to take back the Senate. … New Mexico's Second Congressional District sprawls across the southern half of the state and is represented by Democratic Rep. Xochitl Torres Small.  Republicans eye the district as a potential pickup opportunity given its general Republican lean. … [New Mexico’s] Third Congressional District has attracted a crowded field of Democratic candidates to succeed Rep. Ben Ray Luján, who is running for Senate. … Maryland, which rescheduled its primaries from April 28, will vote in several congressional primaries on Tuesday.”PLAY-BY-PLAYN.C.

"6378","Editor's Note (June 2 at 11:30 a.m.): One paper discussed in this article has been retracted by the journal the Annals of Internal Medicine, meaning that the paper included mistakes so serious that the findings of the research cannot be trusted. The authors wrote that their statistical methods could not determine whether the findings were reliable, making the results of the small study ""uninterpretable."" The study had found that surgical and cotton masks do not effectively contain viral droplets containing SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent research has suggested that face masks are an effective method for containing the spread of the virus, used along with staying six feet apart from other people.","1624090303","1"
"6379","For the first time, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that even seemingly healthy people wear masks over their mouths and noses when venturing out of their homes into places where it is difficult to maintain distance from other people. But there is still major debate over how much masks — particularly the homemade fabric masks that the CDC recommends for the public — can slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.","1624090303","1"
"6380","Researchers, writing in two new papers, attempt to tackle the efficacy of masks, one more rigorously than the other, and come to differing conclusions. One study examined the effect of masks on seasonal coronaviruses (which cause many cases of the common cold) and found that surgical masks are helpful at reducing how much virus a sick person spreads. The other looked particularly at SARS-CoV-2 and found no effect of either surgical or fabric masks on reducing virus spread, but only had four participants and used a crude measure of viral spread.","1624090303","1"
"6381","The bottom line, experts say, is that masks might help keep people with COVID-19 from unknowingly passing along the virus. But the evidence for the efficacy of surgical or homemade masks is limited, and masks aren't the most important protection against the coronavirus.","1624090303","1"
"6382","""Putting a face mask on does not mean that you stop the other practices,"" said May Chu, a clinical professor in epidemiology at the Colorado School of Public Health on the Anschutz Medical Campus who was not involved in either new study. ""It does not mean you get closer to people, it does not mean you don't have to wash your hands as often and you can touch your face. All of that still is in place, this is just an add-on.""","1624090303","1"
"6383","Recommendations about masks can easily get confusing, because all masks are not made equal. The N95 mask effectively prevents viral spread. These masks, when properly fitted, seal closely to the face and filter out 95% of particles 0.3 microns or larger. But N95 masks are in serious shortage even for medical professionals, who are exposed to the highest levels of SARS-CoV-2 and are most in need of the strongest protection against the virus. They're also difficult to fit correctly. For those reasons, the CDC does not recommend them for general use.","1624090303","1"
"6384","Due to shortages, the CDC also does not recommend surgical masks for the general public. These masks don't seal against the face but do include non-woven polypropylene layers that are moisture resistant. In a surgical mask, about 70% of the outside air moves through the mask and about 30% travels around the sides, Chu told Live Science. For that reason, they don't offer as much protection as N95s.","1624090303","1"
"6385","That leaves fabric masks, which currently are recommended for general use by the CDC. Fabric masks also allow air in around the sides, but lack non-woven, moisture-repelling layers. They impede only about 2% of airflow in, Chu said.","1624090303","1"
"6386","All of this leakage in surgical and fabric masks are why public health officials generally don't believe that wearing a mask prevents anyone from catching a virus that is already floating around in the environment. Airflow follows the path of least resistance, said Rachael Jones, an associate professor of family and preventive medicine at the University of Utah who was not involved in the new research. If viral particles are nearby, they have an easy path around a surgical or fabric mask. And in the case of a fabric mask, wearers may well be wafting in particles small enough to flow right through the fabric.","1624090303","1"
"6387","But what about the other way around? When the wearer of a mask coughs or sneezes, the barrier might be enough to contain a lot of that initial jet of grossness — even if there are gaps in the fabric or around the sides. That's what the new mask studies aimed to address: Whether surgical or fabric masks did a good job of containing viruses.","1624090303","1"
"6388","One study, published April 6 in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, found that they did not. That study, led by South Korean researchers, involved asking four patients with COVID-19 to cough into a petri dish 7.8 inches (20 centimeters) away. The patients coughed without masks, while wearing a disposable surgical mask and again wearing a 100% cotton mask.","1624090303","1"
"6389","Neither mask meaningfully decreased the viral load coughed onto the petri dishes. But experts not involved in the study who were contacted by Live Science were hesitant to put much stock into the findings. The researchers didn't look at distances beyond 7.8 inches to see if droplets didn't travel as far while people were wearing masks, Chu said.","1624090303","1"
"6390","The study also returned the odd result that most swabs from the outside of patient masks were positive for coronavirus and most from the inside were negative. The authors speculate that perhaps turbulent jets of air from coughing carried the virus toward the outside of the mask, but the explanation wasn't very satisfying, according to Jones.","1624090303","1"
"6391","The other study, published April 3 in the journal Nature Medicine, used a more sophisticated method of collecting the virus particles that sick people emit. The researchers asked 426 volunteers to breathe for 30 minutes into a cone-like device that captures everything exhaled. Of these, 43 patients had influenza, 54 patients had rhinoviruses and 17 patients had seasonal coronaviruses (the kinds that cause colds, not the kind that causes COVID-19). This method allowed the researchers to quantify how much virus was found in droplet particles, which are greater than 0.0002 inches (5 microns) in diameter, versus aerosol particles, which are 5 microns or smaller. The participants were randomized to either wear a surgical mask or not wear a mask during the study.","1624090303","1"
"6392","And as for masks? Surgical masks reduced the amount of virus released from a sick person in the form of droplets but not aerosols for influenza; the masks reduced coronavirus in both droplets and aerosols; and they didn't reduce either in rhinovirus. For the seasonal coronavirus, researchers found the virus in droplets in 3 out of 10 samples from participants not wearing masks and in aerosols in 4 out of 10 samples taken without masks. In samples taken with masks, no virus was detected in either droplets or aerosols.","1624090303","1"
"6393","The results from influenza and seasonal coronaviruses suggest that surgical masks can help keep people with COVID-19 from spreading the virus, Cowling said. SARS-CoV-2 probably behaves similarly to the viruses he and his team studied, he said, and the fact that people can spread the virus before they experience symptoms is an argument for recommending masks for everyone.","1624090303","1"
"6394","But experts are still mixed on the potential usefulness of non-N95 masks.","1624090303","1"
"6395","""To me, it's not harmful to wear these masks, but it doesn't look from this study like there is a whole lot of benefit,"" Jones said. The sample size for seasonal coronavirus was small, she said, and there was a large amount of non-mask-related variation in how much virus people emitted, particularly given that the majority of samples without masks didn't have detectable coronavirus.","1624090303","1"
"6396","One thing everyone does agree on is that, whatever containment provided by non-fitted masks do provide, homemade fabric masks are the least effective. The recommendations that everyone wear masks are because ""any kind of impediment is better than nothing,"" Chu said. But fabric masks are not expected to be as protective as surgical masks, she said. That's why public health officials are warning people to remain at least 6 feet apart from one another, even if they are wearing masks. In other words, homemade masks are likely to be just a small piece of the puzzle for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.","1624090303","1"
"6397","""There's been enough research done to be able to confidently say that masks wouldn't be able to stop the spread of infection, that they would only have a small effect on transmission,"" Cowling said. ""We shouldn't be relying on masks to help us go back to normal.""","1624090303","1"

Ms. Murkowski said the critique by General Mattis, in which he said that Mr. Trump had divided the nation and failed to lead, was overdue and might be a tipping point that would cause Republicans to air concerns about the president that they had only spoken about privately. ‘I was really thankful,’ Ms. Murkowski told reporters on Capitol Hill. ‘I thought General Mattis’s words were true and honest and necessary and overdue.’ The comments by Ms. Murkowski, one of the few moderate Republicans in Congress who has been willing to break with Mr. Trump, suggested that his response to nationwide unrest over police brutality and racial discrimination had prodded at least some members of the party to reconsider their support for him.”Yuval Levin: ‘The Evils of Injustice and the Danger of Mobocracy’ - National Review: “In recent days, my mind has turned to Abraham Lincoln—maybe the greatest of the great-souled Americans. I’ve thought of him not only because he thought and acted with such moral clarity regarding the evil of racism and the inhumanity of slavery, but also because he understood that no just society was possible without respect for basic social order. He knew there was an ideal of justice above the law, and he knew that it could only be respected and put into effect through the law, not around it. … We incline to worry about angry mobs out of fear that they will harm the innocent, but Lincoln argued that even when their cause is understandable (even when, as in one of his examples, they are rightly livid at ‘the perpetration of an outrageous murder’), their lawlessness is a grave danger, because they ultimately liberate ‘the lawless in spirit…to become lawless in practice,’ and then leave good citizens with no choice but to become lawless in their own defense.”The Judge’s Ruling: ‘America is under attack from three deadly viruses’ - Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano takes the national temperature in his column this week: “America is under attack by three deadly viruses.

While Mr. Biden’s fund-raising efforts have picked up momentum, Mr. Trump is sitting on a considerably larger war chest and is resuming in-person fund-raising next week. There is almost no open dissent within the Republican Party, giving Mr. Trump a solid political foundation on the right from which he can attempt to rebuild his strength before the fall campaign.”Biden nearly doubles Wisconsin lead - Fox News: “Majorities of Wisconsin voters rate the economy negatively and are concerned about coronavirus. That helps explain Democrat Joe Biden’s gains in the presidential race, in a Fox News Poll of Wisconsin registered voters released Wednesday. Biden has a 9-point edge over President Donald Trump, 49-40 percent. That’s up from a 5-point advantage in January, and is outside the poll’s margin of sampling error.  Another 11 percent are uncommitted. A big reason Trump trails Biden is lack of party support: 85 percent of Republicans back him, while 93 percent of Democrats support Biden.  Eight percent of Republicans defect to Biden.  In addition, only 87 percent of those who approve of Trump’s job performance support his reelection.”Ohio back to swing state status as Biden holds narrow lead - Fox News: “A Fox News Poll of Ohio registered voters finds Democrat Joe Biden narrowly tops President Donald Trump in the race for the White House.  At the same time, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine enjoys sky-high, bipartisan approval. Biden is ahead of Trump by a 45 to 43 percent margin. The former vice president’s 2-point edge is within the poll’s margin of sampling error. Voters extremely interested in the election go for Biden by 6 points (51-45 percent). More Democrats (61 percent) than Republicans (55 percent) are extremely interested in the election.”Biden up 4 in Arizona, McSally getting shellacked - Fox News: “Republicans are rightly concerned about Arizona. A new Fox News Poll finds the state shading blue -- especially in the race for the U.S. Senate, where Democrat Mark Kelly bests incumbent Republican Sen. Martha McSally by a 50-37 percent margin among Arizona registered voters. The story here is party loyalty. Some 88 percent of Democrats back Kelly, while just 73 percent of Republicans support McSally.  Fully 13 percent of those backing President Trump in the presidential race cross over and go for Kelly. Gov. Doug Ducey appointed McSally after the 2018 retirement of Sen. John McCain’s successor, Jon Kyl. In a head-to-head presidential ballot test, Democrat Joe Biden edges President Donald Trump by 46-42 percent.  Another 11 percent are still up for grabs. Biden’s 4-point advantage is within the poll’s margin of sampling error.”Texas tight, but undecideds aplenty - Quinnipiac University: “President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden are locked in a very tight race in Texas, with Trump receiving 44 percent of the vote and Biden receiving 43 percent in a general election matchup, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released [Wednesday]. Democrats go for Biden 90 - 5 percent, independents do the same 45 - 36 percent, and Republicans go for Trump 87 - 6 percent. Voters say 54 - 40 percent that Trump would do a better job handling the economy, but say 49 - 43 percent that Biden would do a better job handling health care. Voters are split on who would do a better job handling the response to the coronavirus, as 47 percent say Biden and 45 percent say Trump.”Trump approval on race relations hits 33 percent - CBS News: “President Trump's overall approval rating stands at 40% and disapproval is 54% — both within the historically narrow range in which they vary; neither his lowest nor highest numbers. As always, given high marks from Republicans and faring worse among others. Even fewer approve of his handling of race relations specifically, at 33%. Here again, his own party bolsters the numbers, with 72% of Republicans approving. African-Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the president's overall job performance and his handling of race relations. The public has similarly negative views on the president's response to the situation in Minneapolis: 31% are satisfied with it, while 55% dissatisfied with it.”BIDEN FACES BACKLASH FROM POLICE UNIONSPolitico: “Joe Biden has long prided himself on being a union-friendly Democrat with a ","1625855341","1"

Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made the remarks in a prerecorded graduation speech to students at the National Defense University. Milley advised the students that it is important to keep ‘a keen sense of situational awareness’ and acknowledged his failure to do so on June 1, as he walked from Lafayette Square in combat fatigues alongside the president, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and other senior advisers. ‘As many of you saw the results of the photograph of me in Lafayette Square last week, that sparked a national debate about the role of the military in civil society,’ Milley said.”Trump to resume rallies on friendly turf in Oklahoma - USA Today: “President Donald Trump said Wednesday he plans to headline his first political rallies of the COVID-19 era in five states in the weeks ahead, at least three of them key battlegrounds that could decide whether he remains in the White House. Revivals of his signature political events will begin in Oklahoma, Florida, Texas, Arizona and North Carolina, Trump said, previewing a new phase in a race in which he has fallen behind Democratic challenger Joe Biden in several states – the main reason the president is eager to get back on the road. ‘We're going to start our rallies back up now,’ Trump told reporters at the White House. ‘We've had a tremendous run at rallies. ... It's been an amazing thing to behold.’ Trump plans to return to the stage on June 19 – a week from Friday – at a ‘beautiful new venue’ in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a state that is considered very friendly to him.”Courts controversy with Juneteenth date - AP: “The rally will take place on Juneteenth, the commemoration of the ending of slavery in the United States. Tulsa has its own troubling history on race. Its once-thriving African American business community was decimated in 1921, when a racist white mob killed hundreds of black residents. Black residents attempted to rebuild in the decades that followed, only to see their work erased during urban renewal of the 1960s.”Gets back on the campaign cash hustle - AP: “President Donald Trump is resuming in-person fundraising events after a three-month hiatus as his campaign works to maintain a cash advantage over Democrat Joe Biden that it believes is vital to victory in November. Trump is traveling to Dallas on Thursday to raise more than $10 million for his campaign and the Republican Party, according to a GOP official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the plan. He’ll hold another event Saturday at his private golf course in New Jersey. The moves come at a critical moment in the campaign. Trump’s reelection plans have been rocked by the coronavirus pandemic, a severe economic recession and weeks of nationwide protests over racial injustice. That’s added to a sense of urgency to build on the more than $250 million Trump already has in the bank to overcome stiff headwinds.”Inhoffe looks to claw back commission on removing Confederate names - Roll Call: “Oklahoma Republican James M. Inhofe, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Thursday he will try to dilute his panel's newly minted proposal requiring the Defense Department to rename bases and other assets named after Confederates. The committee approved a fiscal 2021 defense authorization bill, or NDAA, on Wednesday evening. The measure includes an amendment by Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., that would establish a commission that would make recommendations on how, not whether, to change the names of bases, ships and more. The commission would have up to three years to work. The committee adopted the amendment by voice vote during it's closed-door deliberations. But Inhofe told reporters he does not agree with the provision, and he indicated precisely how he might try to weaken it, either on the Senate floor or in conference.”Lawmaker wondered if COVID rates for ‘colored’ Ohioans due to bad hygiene - The Columbus Dispatch: “During a hearing Tuesday on whether to declare racism a public health crisis in Ohio, a GOP state senator referred to ‘the colored population’ and questioned whether they get COVID-19 more often because they do not wash their hands as much. During a discussion with Angela Dawson, executive director of the Ohio Commission on Minority Health, Sen. Steve Huffman, a doctor from Tipp City north of Dayton, said, ‘I understand that African Americans have a higher incidence of prior conditions and that makes them more susceptible to COVID, but does not make them more susceptible just to get COVID.’ ‘We know it’s twice as often, correct? Could it just be that African Americans – the colored population — do not wash their hands as well as other groups? Or wear a mask? Or do not socially distance themselves? Could that just be maybe the explanation of why there’s a higher incidence?’”Henninger: ‘The media’s self-censors’ - WSJ: “In the past week, the editorial page editor of the New York Times, the editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer and the editors of Bon Appétit magazine and the young women’s website Refinery 29 have been forced out by the staff and owners of their publications for offenses regarded as at odds with the beliefs of the current protests. It is impossible not to recognize the irony of these events. The silencers aren’t campus protesters but professional journalists, a class of American workers who for nearly 250 years have had a constitutionally protected and court-enforced ability to say just about anything they want. Historically, people have been attracted to American journalism because it was the freest imaginable place to work for determined, often quirky individualists. Suddenly, it looks like the opposite of that.”ANOTHER 1.5 MILLION LAID OFF WaPo: “Another 1.5 million people applied for unemployment insurance for the first time last week, adding to the tens of millions of people who have applied for the insurance since the pandemic began and continuing a months-long drop in the number of initial claims. The numbers remain at historically high levels. The number gig and formerly self-employed workers that applied for the supplemental insurance that is newly available for them went up to 705,000, from 620,000 the week before, under the expanded federal program that grants them benefits. More than 40 million people have applied for unemployment benefits during the pandemic, a sky-high toll that paints a picture of the economic devastation that the coronavirus and the shutdowns that have helped contain it have left in their wake. The numbers add to the complicated economic outlook that the United States faces as it works to reopen for business while containing further spread of the virus at the same time.”Fed warns of years-long struggle - NYT: “The head of the Federal Reserve on Wednesday offered a grim assessment of how quickly the U.S. economy will recover from its pandemic-induced recession, suggesting that millions of people could remain out of work for an extended period as central bank officials estimated unemployment will be at 9.3 percent by the end of 2020. The Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, said the labor market might have ‘hit bottom’ after recording a 14.7 percent unemployment rate in April, but made clear that it was too soon to know for certain. ‘This is the biggest economic shock, in the U.S. and the world, really, in living memory,’ Mr. Powell said… The sober projections, the Fed’s first estimates of 2020, depicted a very different economic path from the quick ‘V-shaped recovery’ that President Trump has suggested is underway as he pushes states to reopen and remove the stay-at-home orders that have contributed to bringing business activity to a halt.”Virus surge continues - NPR: “The U.S. has reached another dire landmark in its fight against COVID-19, surpassing 2 million confirmed cases on Wednesday. New coronavirus infections are rising in at least 20 states, even as restrictions on daily life continue to ease across the country. As of Thursday morning, more than 112,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S. — the most fatalities reported by any nation, according to a tracker from Johns Hopkins University. And most experts believe those numbers underestimate the true toll. The latest data also reflects the difficulty of quashing the coronavirus. While some early hot spots such as New York state have seen a sustained drop in new cases, COVID-19 hospitalizations have swelled recently in places like Texas, Arizona, Arkansas and California. Texas set new records for COVID-19 hospitalizations on three consecutive days this week, with a total of 2,153 hospitalized patients on Wednesday. The state was among the first to start the reopening process…”Bob Greene: ‘Requiem for the Printing Press’ - WSJ: “This week the Miami Herald announced that it is officially moving out of its offices.

"6864","Massachusetts' quest to acquire these masks was a tense, weekslong saga that began with the state's governor and winded through embassies, private partners and the U.S.'s most successful football franchise. After a layover in Alaska and an anxious process to win approval from Chinese officials, the plane was given permission to land in China to collect the masks.","1693616187","1"
"6865","The effort began with Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, who was concerned about the state's mask supply and, two weeks ago, believed he had struck a deal to acquire more than a million of them from a collection of Chinese manufacturers. But officials had to figure out how to get them shipped out of China at a time when unusual cargo shipments out of the country can be especially tricky.","1693616187","1"
"6866","In addition to handling the logistics and the plane, the Kraft family had agreed to pay $2 million, or approximately half the cost of the goods. The order of 1.7 million N95 masks was produced by various manufacturers across the country. ""What we needed,"" said Jim Nolan, who spearheaded the logistics as the COO of Kraft Sports and Entertainment, ""were boots on the ground to gather the goods and get them to the right place.""","1693616187","1"
"6867","They needed even more than that: the products needed to be counted, inspected and then quickly ushered through customs. Through intermediaries, people familiar with the matter said, they were connected to executives at Chinese tech giant Tencent, who pledged a crew of more than a dozen people. Over the course of several days, the Tencent team mobilized to inspect and aggregate the masks. Some facilities had less than promised and were still waiting on the production to be complete. The crew stayed with the goods overnight to make sure nothing happened to them before taking them to the Shenzhen airport and shuttling them through customs.","1693616187","1"
"6868","By early Wednesday morning on the East Coast, the Patriots' 767 had landed in Shenzhen from Alaska. It stayed grounded for 2 hours and 57 minutes -- just within the three-hour window the crew was given. Because cargo wasn't allowed on parts of the passenger plane, only 1.2 million of the masks fit. The rest, which is being held securely by Tencent, will be transported shortly on another shipment.","1693616187","1"
"6869","The plane headed back to Alaska, and then Boston. But that wasn't the last stop for some of the masks. Robert Kraft, despite his franchise's historical acrimony with the New York Jets, has always held a soft spot for New York. He attended Columbia University, has a residence in the city and said he was especially moved when the two teams played in the first weekend of games after the 9/11 attacks, when the Patriots were led out of the tunnel by a Patriots' player whose family members served in the New York City Fire Department and were being cheered on the field.","1693616187","1"

"6875","President Trump continuously has defended his administration's response, from barring non-citizens arriving on flights from China in January to the numerous actions taken by the White House Coronavirus Task Force. However, initial test kits that were produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in February to detect the virus turned out to be faulty, and memos showed that the administration, while internally warned of the possibility of a devastating pandemic in January, did not start large-scale orders of N95 masks and other medical equipment until mid-March.","1693640235","1"
"6876","""It's not just the hospitals that need this, but everybody,"" Loder said. The CDC's recommendation that Americans wear protective covering over their faces when going outside has created a need for homemade masks, which Loder's teams have picked up and dropped off at grocery stores and other places where workers could distribute them.","1693640235","1"
"6877","""We are planning for the long term,” Loder said. ""If you deliver rivers of supplies three months from now, it will be too late. Doctors will be dead.

"7007","According to 30-year-old Andre Ross, a shop steward for Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West who works as an $18.31-an-hour janitor at Southern California Hospital at Hollywood, in the early days of the spread of the virus, some housekeepers tried to use protective masks but were informed that these were reserved for doctors and nurses. One of them, a housekeeper in her 70s who has worked at the hospital for many years, brought a mask from home and used it day after day. “They’re terrified,” Ross told the Times. “They’re upset. They feel like they’re being treated differently.” Many won’t speak up because they fear administrative retaliation. ","1574791901","5"
"7008","Ross himself goes home every day from work, sticks his scrubs in a bag, puts everything in the washing machine, then showers and disinfects his bathroom. He worries about getting the disease for the obvious reason but also because finances are tight—as they are for low-wage workers in general—and he feels he can’t afford to take a day off. Initially, he didn’t get a mask. Now, the only time he wears full protective gear is when he disinfects a COVID-19 patient’s room. Ross and other interviewees made clear they that are anxious and stressed by the pandemic and their part in keeping down the death toll.","1574791901","5"
"7009","Here is the latest and best on masks for the public.","1573906937","5"
"7010","BREAKING -- The government is expected to recommend that Americans where cloth masks when the are in public, according to a federal official. Announcement could come as soon as today, per reporting from the great @abbygoodnough. https://t.co/uOiU2rmZ2x","1573906937","5"
"7011","I wrote my previous article on masks on Feb. 29, which, in CoronaTime was approximately a millennium ago. It would be another week and a half before the WHO would even declare COVID-19 a pandemic. Both the science and the pandemic itself have shifted and are continuing to shift. That article’s information was true at the time, and most of it remains true now. It addressed one main question: should you wear a mask to protect yourself from infection? ","1573906937","5"
"7012","The big question is: Should everyone wear a mask to protect other people from infection? It’s an important question, a question that could not be adequately answered a month ago (I’ll get to why), a question that’s being and appropriately considered and debated now, and a question all of us desperately want an answer to.","1573906937","5"
"7013","The best answer for the moment: Quite possibly, yes, universal mask wearing might decrease asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission of the disease. The evidence isn’t strong, solid, or crystal clear (it rarely is), but it might be better to err on the side of trying it. It won’t surprise me if the CDC shortly comes out with a mask recommendation to reduce community spread.","1573906937","5"
"7014","If the virus is traveling through the air, then it seems intuitive that masks would block it. But the evidence for this is all over the place, especially for surgical masks, which are more common than N95 respirators, and which don’t form a tight seal with the face. Several past studies have found that face masks could reduce the risk of flu-like infections, slow flu transmission in households, and even reduce the spread of SARS, especially when combined with hand-washing and gloves. Other studies have been more equivocal, finding that masks provide no benefit, small benefits, or benefits only in conjunction with measures like hand-washing. “Airflow follows the path of least resistance, and if it won’t enter through the mesh, it can come in from the side,” Bourouiba said. “There’s no evidence whatsoever to suggest that [surgical masks] are protective against the smallest droplets.”  ","1573906937","5"
"7015","There’s still a good case for masks, though, even if they can’t stop viruses from getting in: They can stop viruses from getting out. “I’ve been slightly dismissive of masks, but I was looking at them in the wrong way,” Harvard’s Bill Hanage told me. “You’re not wearing them to stop yourself getting infected, but to stop someone else getting infected.” This might be especially important for SARS-CoV-2, which can spread without immediately causing symptoms. If people are infectious before they fall sick, then everyone should wear face masks “when going out in public, in one additional societal effort to slow the spread of the virus down,” says Thomas Inglesby of the John Hopkins Center for Health Security.","1573906937","5"
"7016","Whether more people should wear masks has become one of the fiercest debates of the coronavirus pandemic. New data about how the virus spreads may be tipping the scales.","1573906937","5"
"7017","As Americans wait for more guidance from the federal government, we’ll tackle three questions currently at the heart of the fast-changing mask debate: Who can spread the virus? Can the virus be airborne? What’s the difference between the types of masks? But first, some overall context:","1573906937","5"
"7018","The debate over mask use — happening inside the Trump administration, academia, and hospitals whose workers are caring for COVID-19 patients — is getting increasingly heated. Public health experts have been pushing back against the narrow federal guidelines stating that face masks should only be worn by health care workers, people caring for the ill, or those who are actively displaying symptoms.","1573906937","5"
"7019","What it means for the general public is still confusing and ethically murky. There is a lethal shortage of medical masks — both the rigid, snug-fitting N95 respirators and the looser-fitting surgical masks — for health care workers, and there will be even fewer if the general public buys them en masse. And as people turn to making homemade masks from craft kits or old T-shirts, it’s still unclear how much these even help prevent the spread of the disease or prevent the wearer from contracting it.","1573906937","5"
"7020","The primary defense made of Trump is to compare his laggard response against the straw-man alternative in which the only alternative was to close down everything three months ago. “Now we’re going to act as if politicians were negligent for failing to try to lock down the entire economy in early January?” writes Harsanyi mockingly. Obviously, there were numerous steps available short of a total lockdown. Indeed, the massive lockdown was only necessary because Trump failed to take any advance steps, like mobilizing an effective testing system, stockpiling masks and ventilators, and reconstituting some kind of structure to replace the pandemic response team he dismantled in 2018.","1573906937","5"
"7021","Another example: the simple face mask, used to prevent infection. Initially, many experts said masks should be reserved for health care workers. On Twitter, Mukherjee has become an evangelist for the idea, now popular, that everyone should wear one. But there’s a problem. Which masks?","1573906923","5"
"7022","“Because there is no central masking authority, as it were, no one knows which ones work and which ones don’t work and which ones are made of what material and who’s decontaminating them,” Mukherjee said. “Because there’s no place to go to find out.”","1573906923","5"
"7023","Whether a mask made from a T-shirt prevents infection is a scientifically testable hypothesis. But we need to conduct the tests. What we’ve been missing throughout this terrible battle is information — data, well-analyzed.","1573906923","5"

"7034","In the latter example, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) had implemented a new policy Thursday based on the CDC’s guidance requiring patrons to wear facial coverings. “Following this guidance, we URGE all customers to wear a mask or other facial covering when traveling on SEPTA to protect customers and Operators. Surgical masks are being distributed to frontline Operations personnel as part of this effort,” the SEPTA said on its website. “Please comply with this request for your protection and the protection of others.”","1576471665","5"

Apparently unwilling to be photographed in a mask, Trump instead chose to potentially expose everyone he came in contact with instead.

For example, several Black men recently came forward saying they were profiled in a store while wearing the masks.

So has Mike Pence’s press secretary, Katie Miller, who has not only been maskless at recent White House meetings but is married to top Trump staffer Stephen Miller. “It is scary to go to work,” top economic adviser Kevin Hassett said on CBS Sunday morning, adding an admission sure to be perceived as disloyal: “I think that I’d be a lot safer if I was sitting at home than I would be going to the West Wing.”","1603585788","5"
"7220","Pence “has tested negative every single day and plans to be at the White House tomorrow,” a spokesman said Sunday, despite Trump’s keen observation last week that Miller “tested very good for a long period of time and then all of a sudden today she tested positive.” Funny how that can work.

Not just Trump and Pence are getting tested daily; top aides are now being rigorously tested as well. Trump allegedly now wants his valets to wear masks, after weeks of belittling mask-wearers and discouraging others in his administration from wearing them. And Trump is apparently now getting irritated when other people stand too close to him, signaling that even the idiot manchild knows what death is, and knows that ""social distancing"" can prevent it.","1603674471","5"

Trump might bristle at people getting too close to him in his workplace but what happens to you in your workplace is so irrelevant that both Trump and Senate Republicans are now devoted to passing new law declaring that businesses who expose workers or customers to the virus, perhaps killing them, shall be granted immunity from liability for those deaths.","1603674471","5"

"7244","The decision to wear a mask in public is becoming a political statement — a moment to pick sides in a brewing culture war over containing the coronavirus.","1606992196","5"
"7245","While not yet as loaded as a “Make America Great Again” hat, the mask is increasingly a visual shorthand for the debate pitting those willing to follow health officials’ guidance and cover their faces against those who feel it violates their freedom or buys into a threat they think is overblown.","1606992196","5"
"7246","That resistance is fueled by some of the same people who object to other virus restrictions. The push back has been stoked by President Donald Trump — he didn’t wear a mask during an appearance at a facility making them — and some other Republicans, who have flouted rules and questioned the value of masks. It’s a development that has worried experts as Americans are increasingly returning to public spaces.","1606992196","5"
"7247","It’s not just Trump, as the Associated Press notes. Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky—a frickin’ doctor, no less!—recently added fuel to the anti-mask extremists’ fire when he asked: “Who knows what the truth is on masks?” Compare that with New York’s Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who asked a different question: “How people cannot wear masks—that to me is even disrespectful. You put so many people at risk because you did not want to wear a mask?”","1606992196","5"
"7248","To be clear, Trump is not responsible for every act of anti-mask-related violence, and not everyone who commits such an act is necessarily a Trump supporter. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that Trump has, through his words and his actions—such as not wearing a mask in situations where he definitely should—given aid and comfort to the most extreme elements of the anti-safety protestors.","1606992196","5"
"7249","Beyond the politics, there’s also the ideological substance behind the Trumpist anti-mask radicals. It boils down to a rigid, ultra-libertarian “you can’t tell me what to do” ideology, combined with a Social Darwinist/Ayn Rand-influenced loathing or even hatred of anyone seen as weak—including anyone “weak” enough to actually die from a COVID-19 infection.","1606992196","5"
"7250","While the lockdown has certainly caused real pain for people, wearing a mask is—by any rational standard—relatively painless.

These so-called “patriots” not only don’t care about their fellow Americans—in some cases, such as that sociopath at the Dollar Tree, they appear happy to help push them along into an early grave. There is a complete lack of empathy on their part.

"7251","By contrast, empathy is a core value for progressives. Concern for one’s neighbors and one’s fellow Americans more broadly undergirds progressive policy approaches on matters as varied as tax policy, the minimum wage, health care, the environment, and civil rights.

"7252","We are, in Obama’s words, “one American family.” It doesn’t seem too much to ask that one wear a mask to protect members of one’s family. Yet for Trumpist Republicans and, in particular, the anti-mask extremists, no such responsibility to others exists. Except, of course, for those near (if not necessarily dear) to Trump himself, who on Monday decreed that anyone who comes into the West Wing must “wear a mask or face covering” now that COVID-19 has broken through into the Trump-Pence inner circle. Everyone must now wear a mask at all times, unless they are alone at their desks. Predictably, early indications are that Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will not be bound by the new rule. Trump himself won’t wear a mask because ""he's a unique individual,"" according to a White House official. ""He can't be seen walking around wearing a mask."" Well, “unique” is certainly one word for him.","1606992196","5"

Gov. Jared Polis responded by suspending the restaurant’s license indefinitely with a 30-day minimum and called the restaurant an “immediate health hazard.” Now, owners of the restaurant are suing Gov. Polis, the state, and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), arguing that their constitutional rights have been violated, as reported by The Denver Channel.","1617540023","5"
"7299","Some background on what’s been up in Colorado: Restaurants and bars in the state had been to-go and delivery only since March 19. The Mother’s Day video appeared on May 10. There was a public health order through May 26, which included social distancing of six feet between people, wearing masks, and no gatherings of more than 10 people. As of Wednesday, May 27, restaurants will be allowed to offer dine-in service, but with some safety measures still in place—mainly that restaurants may only operate at 50% of capacity or fewer than 50 people depending on the specific restaurant, six feet between tables, and all employees wearing masks. ","1617540023","5"
"7300","The Castle Rock eatery, however, opened for Mother’s Day, and based on what caught attention on social media, there was a long line of customers, tons of people dining at tables, and few people actually wearing masks.

"7305","According to recent polls, mask-wearing is supported by an overwhelming majority of Democrats, a very strong majority of independents … and even a majority of Republicans.

"7306","When it comes to whether Trump should wear a mask, as many as 48% of Republicans say yes. One Democratic tracking poll finds that “mask” is showing up in open-ended answers about what negative things people have heard about Trump’s handling of coronavirus. That poll showed a key way Trump is splitting Republicans. Just 39% of Republicans said they disapproved of Trump’s decision not to wear a mask—a number that’s been up to 48% in another poll—but 69% of Republicans said they thought elected officials should wear masks in government buildings. Plenty of Republicans are willing to hold Trump to a different standard than they hold anyone else to, but there’s probably some strain when he forces them to do so.","1618009985","5"

But Republicans are seriously divided over mask-wearing, with even many high-ranking elected Republicans promoting it. That shows the limits of Trump’s control.

"7315","And apparently masks are another thing that are just an opinion. Trump has repeatedly refused to wear one, even when every person around him was wearing a mask. He’s refused to wear one even when local regulations required that he wear a mask. And as Trump has refused to wear a mask, he’s also fueled a growing number of bullies and plain old jackasses among his followers who have been harassing people whose only crime is trying to protect everyone’s health. Unsurprisingly, Trump tossed fresh kindling on that fire Wednesday morning by retweeting a claim from The Federalist that masks aren’t about health but “social control,” and that Joe Biden wearing a mask endorses “slavery.”","1619340047","5"

"7318","And then there are those who, for political purposes, are trying to make masks into something other than a public health measure. Those people are willing to put the lives of everyone at risk for the purposes of engendering division, sparking hatred, inciting bullying, and triggering violence.","1619340047","5"
"7319","Not even every Fox News host is in the latter camp. Even someone as regularly willing to flog injustice for a momentary gain in ratings or power as Sean Hannity has recognized that wearing a mask provides protection and is something that should be done to protect everyone you care about. But other Foxites, like Laura Ingraham, have fueled the flames of treating masks as political symbols. ","1619340047","5"
"7320","In many cases—including Ingraham’s—the effort to turn masks into a political symbol isn’t just tragic, it’s also transparent.

"7321","Autocrats always find it handy to have a marker for those who are in their camp, like an armband. Or a red hat. It’s handy to have a symbol for people on the other side.

"7323","Somebody can read the polls. For weeks, a large majority of the American public has been saying that face masks should be worn to help stem the spread of coronavirus, particularly now that states are forging ahead with reopening plans.

""That's not too much to ask of a younger person,"" McConnell said. ""So to get through this next phase, as we ease back into normal, even if you're in a low-risk category, do what we're asking you to do for the good of others as we begin to move back to normal."" As if McConnell cares about the good of others. No, there's an angle here, a political one.","1619517168","5"
"7325","More likely McConnell is thinking about where the American public is right now and thinks it can't hurt to err on their side on the mask thing, even if it means potentially angering Trump.

Let’s make fun of Biden for wearing a mask, even though 72% of Americans think it’s smart and important to wear a mask. That’s not a campaign decision based on winning votes, that’s a campaign decision meant to get cheers from his existing supporters. Which, again, would make some sense if he was winning. But he’s not. He’s losing. ","1620357215","5"

"7338","Trump's mask posture is just incredibly stupid on so many levels. It's only playing to a fringe group of Trump’s loyalists within the Republican party and it's setting him up to take the blame if a second coronavirus wave spikes after he pushed the country to reopen.

"7339","Meanwhile, the country is reopening and new hot spots of infection are emerging and the medical and science officials in the White House are disappearing, along with it the messages about the importance of social distancing, mask wearing, and hand-washing to ward off the virus.

It suppresses your immune system.” Smith argued that not only was wearing a mask unnecessary but that it prevents bartenders from properly doing their job, including seeing an individual’s face to verify their identity. In conversation with the Post, he questioned how one could drink a beer while covering their face.","1621142920","5"

"7367","As many Kos readers will have already seen in the news, my organization, Public Justice, filed suit against a Smithfield packing plant in Milan, Missouri on behalf of a courageous worker who stood up to demand safety protocols and equipment to protect herself, and her co-workers, from the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to her bravery, a national outcry was heard that put enormous pressure on Smithfield to implement changes and take small (though not by any means fully sufficient) steps in the right direction. Earlier this week, the judge in that case dismissed our lawsuit, citing OSHA as the proper regulatory authority. But OSHA’s oversight has been random and discretionary at best, and completely missing in action at worst. Though the workers in Milan have been given more protections than they had before the lawsuit (such as some ability to practice social distancing, mask policies, improved paid sick leave and stronger barriers between workers on the slaughter line), that was the direct result of the workers who spoke out and sued, and not because of the goodwill of Smithfield. The industry as a whole – and the government agencies responsible for overseeing them – have a long way to go.","1623859156","5"

Do it for the good of the family.” President Obama also often spoke of America being a family, whereas Trump only tries to keep us divided. Going beyond words on responsibility, Gov.

Those who are around someone coughing and clearly ill are also more likely to take precautions. Those who catch COVID-19 from symptomatic carriers are usually family members and others who are forced to remain in close contact with someone even though they are coughing, sweating, and clearly a hazard.","1630270486","5"

"7401","So basically ICE and its $8 billion annual budget is forcing detained people and their advocates to have to go to court for weeks and months to fight for what are crumbs compared to its vast resources in order to try to stay safe.

Most of those who have taken place in the wholly necessary protests following the murder of George Floyd have been careful to wear masks and take what precautions they could.

Could it just be that African Americans—the colored population—do not wash their hands as well as other groups? Or wear a mask? Or do not socially distance themselves?

"7417","The decision to wear a mask in public is becoming a political statement — a moment to pick sides in a brewing culture war over containing the coronavirus.","1634250408","5"
"7418","While not yet as loaded as a “Make America Great Again” hat, the mask is increasingly a visual shorthand for the debate pitting those willing to follow health officials’ guidance and cover their faces against those who feel it violates their freedom or buys into a threat they think is overblown.","1634250408","5"
"7419","That resistance is fueled by some of the same people who object to other virus restrictions. The push back has been stoked by President Donald Trump — he didn’t wear a mask during an appearance at a facility making them — and some other Republicans, who have flouted rules and questioned the value of masks. It’s a development that has worried experts as Americans are increasingly returning to public spaces.","1634250408","5"
"7420","It’s not just Trump, as the Associated Press notes. Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky—a frickin’ doctor, no less!—recently added fuel to the anti-mask extremists’ fire when he asked: “Who knows what the truth is on masks?” Compare that with New York’s Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who asked a different question: “How people cannot wear masks—that to me is even disrespectful. You put so many people at risk because you did not want to wear a mask?”","1634250408","5"
"7421","To be clear, Trump is not responsible for every act of anti-mask-related violence, and not everyone who commits such an act is necessarily a Trump supporter. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that Trump has, through his words and his actions—such as not wearing a mask in situations where he definitely should—given aid and comfort to the most extreme elements of the anti-safety protestors.","1634250408","5"
"7422","Beyond the politics, there’s also the ideological substance behind the Trumpist anti-mask radicals. It boils down to a rigid, ultra-libertarian “you can’t tell me what to do” ideology, combined with a Social Darwinist/Ayn Rand-influenced loathing or even hatred of anyone seen as weak—including anyone “weak” enough to actually die from a COVID-19 infection.","1634250408","5"
"7423","While the lockdown has certainly caused real pain for people, wearing a mask is—by any rational standard—relatively painless. Yet these zealots are unwilling to put one on and help other people stay healthy and alive. These so-called “patriots” not only don’t care about their fellow Americans—in some cases, such as that sociopath at the Dollar Tree, they appear happy to help push them along into an early grave. There is a complete lack of empathy on their part. Really, though, this is little more than an extreme version of the same old Republican values that preach “I got mine, go get yours (or just go fuck yourself).” ","1634250408","5"
"7424","By contrast, empathy is a core value for progressives. Concern for one’s neighbors and one’s fellow Americans more broadly undergirds progressive policy approaches on matters as varied as tax policy, the minimum wage, health care, the environment, and civil rights. For progressives, wearing a mask when you’re unable to stay more than six feet away from another American (or any human being) is not only common sense, but vital to how we view our responsibilities to one another. ","1634250408","5"
"7425","We are, in Obama’s words, “one American family.” It doesn’t seem too much to ask that one wear a mask to protect members of one’s family. Yet for Trumpist Republicans and, in particular, the anti-mask extremists, no such responsibility to others exists. Except, of course, for those near (if not necessarily dear) to Trump himself, who on Monday decreed that anyone who comes into the West Wing must “wear a mask or face covering” now that COVID-19 has broken through into the Trump-Pence inner circle. Everyone must now wear a mask at all times, unless they are alone at their desks. Predictably, early indications are that Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will not be bound by the new rule. Trump himself won’t wear a mask because ""he's a unique individual,"" according to a White House official. ""He can't be seen walking around wearing a mask."" Well, “unique” is certainly one word for him.","1634250408","5"

"7451","Researchers, writing in two new papers, attempt to tackle the efficacy of masks, one more rigorously than the other, and come to differing conclusions. One study examined the effect of masks on seasonal coronaviruses (which cause many cases of the common cold) and found that surgical masks are helpful at reducing how much virus a sick person spreads. The other looked particularly at SARS-CoV-2 and found no effect of either surgical or fabric masks on reducing virus spread, but only had four participants and used a crude measure of viral spread.","1698397225","5"
"7452","The bottom line, experts say, is that masks might help keep people with COVID-19 from unknowingly passing along the virus. But the evidence for the efficacy of surgical or homemade masks is limited, and masks aren't the most important protection against the coronavirus.","1698397225","5"

But it became very clear to me after we put out the order that everyone in retail who walked into a store as a customer would have to do that, it became clear to me that that was just a bridge too far.

"7884","April 9 (UPI) — Since COVID-19 started spreading in the United States, a debate has raged over whether the public should wear masks — and until recently, the answer was no.","1599147038","3"
"7885","The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the nation’s leading government health agency, now says that wearing a protective mask is recommended for people who need to be in public settings — including a run to the grocery store — when “other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.”","1599147038","3"
"7886","The World Health Organization, however, issued guidance this week that seemingly contradicts the CDC, saying that healthy people in the community wearing masks is not supported by current evidence and carries risks, including self-contamination.","1599147038","3"
"7887","Much of the confusion revolves around the purpose of wearing the masks, Reynolds said. Many Americans seems to think that wearing a mask will help keep them from getting sick, which is not the case.","1599147038","3"
"7888","“What the WHO is saying is, ‘Wearing a mask won’t necessarily protect you from getting the infection, but it will help prevent you from spreading the disease to others if you don’t have symptoms and don’t know you’re sick.’ And the CDC is recommending masks to prevent spread of COVID-19,” Reynolds said.","1599147038","3"
"7889","Data on the new coronavirus is limited — the key word being “new” — but scientific evidence exists supporting the use of face masks to cover the nose and mouth to prevent disease spread when the primary route of transmission is through “aerosols,” Reynolds said.","1599147038","3"
"7890","“We don’t know how effective wearing a mouth and nose covering like a bandana or mask is for COVID-19, but it has what we call ‘biological plausibility,'” Dr. Mark Dworkin, professor of epidemiology at the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health, told UPI.","1599147038","3"
"7891","“That means that it makes sense if you were blocking a COVID-carrying droplet immediately in front of someone’s face. We do this for well people all the time when we mask up a surgeon before they do a surgery,” Dworkin said.","1599147038","3"
"7892","One argument against the use of face masks by the public has been the limited supply of “healthcare-grade” N95 coverings available. Most experts — including those at the CDC and WHO — agree that these masks should be reserved for front-line healthcare workers, which is why the CDC has been advocating for use of homemade masks “like a bandana,” Dworkin said.","1599147038","3"

But most of the difference between DeSantis and Cuomo is due to politics. DeSantis governs a politically divided state.

So, the president is fighting his own government, and his rebellion tweets.

"8166","Pelosi said, “100,000 people —more than 100,000 people have died from the coronavirus. This administration has been a failure in terms of what we’re doing when testing and tracing and treating and isolating people. The president has been a terrible example of not wearing a mask, belittling those who do. So anything he does is a distraction from the problem at hand. People are dying, Rome is burning, and all people want to talk about is what he said next about this. That is a success for him. So I just will not go there. It’s about testing, testing, testing, to open up our schools so our children can go back safely. It’s about opening up our economy, so we can flourish. It’s about saving lives. And all of this is a distraction from the problem at hand. We have people dying, and he’s talking about one thing and another and then monopolizes the whole conversation. I simply won’t go there.”","1619427340","3"
"8167","She added, “When we talk about opening up, it’s foolish to open up in any way other than that which has guidelines about distancing and masks and the rest. And to do so in a way that preserves health and not endangers people. Because when you go out there, you’re not only endangering yourself, you’re bringing something home to your children or your parents if they’re older in that category with the predisposition. So this is about acting unselfishly. You don’t wear a mask. You’re being very selfish. It’s not about how strong you think you are. It’s how unconcerned you are about what you might spread to someone else. Of course, we all want to be out. That’s natural. I like the idea of fresh air, as a matter of fact, for my children and grandchildren. However, you have to do so in a very, very safe way. And that’s what leadership the administration should be taking instead of saying magically go away. It’s a hoax. Magically, this, that and the other thing. Face the facts, face the reality of what it is, and only then we’ll be able as we understand the challenge, address the needs, do it in a robust and fast way so that we diminish the death toll.”","1619427340","3"

"8187","No less than the New England Journal of Medicine has dealt a body blow to America’s growing army of mask fascists with the news that “wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection.”","1620444474","3"
"8188","We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic.","1620444474","3"
"8189","Obviously, as the Journal points out, if you are a healthcare worker, you are going to be dealing with someone infectious indoors, in a closed setting, and not just passing by. So the Journal warns that the “mask is a core component of the personal protective equipment (PPE) clinicians need when caring for symptomatic patients with respiratory viral infections, in conjunction with gown, gloves, and eye protection.”","1620444474","3"
"8190","Even so, the Journal’s warning for healthcare workers points out that a mask is still not very helpful “since it does not provide protection from droplets that may enter the eyes or from fomites on the patient or in the environment that providers may pick up on their hands and carry to their mucous membranes.”","1620444474","3"
"8191","“What is clear, however, is that universal masking alone is not a panacea. A mask will not protect providers caring for a patient with active Covid-19 if it’s not accompanied by meticulous hand hygiene, eye protection, gloves, and a gown,” the Journal adds.","1620444474","3"
"8192","Baller adds that the danger to a healthy person wearing a mask is a “false feeling of protection” — which is something the CDC warned of early on during this pandemic, back when we were told not to wear masks.","1620444474","3"
"8193","Of course, the CDC has flip-flopped completely on the mask issue, which means that what we are now being told by the New England Journal of Medicine and W.H.O. contradicts the latest CDC guidelines, which, after telling us for weeks that masks are useless against the virus, now “recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.”","1620444474","3"
"8194","Since its flip-flop, I have never really bought into the idea that American health “experts” like the CDC and Drs. Fauci and Birx were genuine in their flip-flop on the mask issue. It always seemed to me that public and media pressure forced them into caving.","1620444474","3"
"8195","Even today, Fauci can’t bring himself to offer a full-throated mask endorsement, only that the mask is a “symbol” of what “you should be doing” … they are a “valuable safeguard” and part of “respect for another person.”","1620444474","3"
"8196","“There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask,” infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told 60 Minutes.","1620444474","3"
"8197","While masks may block some droplets, Fauci said, they do not provide the level of protection people think they do. Wearing a mask may also have unintended consequences: People who wear masks tend to touch their face more often to adjust them, which can spread germs from their hands.","1620444474","3"
"8198","It would seem to me that the need to wear a mask should be based on how the virus in question operates. If, as the New England Journal of Medicine points out, you need to be in close contact with an infected person for up to 30 minutes in order to get infected with the coronavirus, the mask is unnecessary unless you’re in that situation.","1620444474","3"
"8199","Out of concern for my wife, I’ve worn a mask since day one, even when Fauci was telling me not to… And I will continue to, at least for the foreseeable future, even though I hate the damn thing.","1620444474","3"
"8200","Sadly, though, this latest science against wearing masks will get no traction in our corrupt corporate media or with the corrupt Democrat politicians who have embraced mask fascism with the unbridled glee that all self-righteous bullies embrace such things, embrace any opportunity to join a pious mob and feels a false sense of superiority while shaming and terrorizing others.","1620444474","3"

Because I’ve seen, on TV, as the demonstrations start to heat up, people might take their masks off when they’re starting to yell and scream and demonstrate. Keep your mask on.

But our hope is that people know that we still have to live with the coronavirus, that we need to wear our masks. We cannot just drop our guard.

But refrain from the handshakes and the high-fives and the hugs that we know bring us in close proximity. And when you’re speaking, keep that mask on.

"8361","So for weeks, through all of this, the C.D.C. and the Surgeon General have told us that we shouldn't buy facemasks. Facemasks are not useful for stopping the coronavirus, they've said. In fact, they could make us sick and also we need to save them for first responders. ","800432","8"
"8362","Well, the administration's mask guidance is a welcome change. But if you read it carefully, you'll notice and recognize it recommends cloth coverings over your mouth, not necessarily medical masks. And there's a reason for that. The reason is this. America doesn't produce nearly enough medical masks. ","800432","8"
"8363","And as we showed last night, some of the masks we do produce, some of them are made abroad are not making their way to American hospitals. ","800432","8"
"8364","And so when I asked 3M, you know, what is your production? They said they're making 10 million masks a week. And when I said, great, I have money. I'd like to purchase some of those. They said I couldn't. ","800432","8"
"8365","CARLSON: That's infuriating. Today, thank heaven, the President invoked the Defense Production Act to ban for their mask exports and he singled out the company 3M for specific criticism. Watch. ","800432","8"
"8366","So 3M was shipping masks to other countries rather than the United States. Will that end now? ","800432","8"
"8367","NAVARRO: Tucker, let you say that 3M needs to stop whining and just produce masks and give them to the American people, and I've been dealing with hundreds of CEOs on the frontlines here of President Trump's war against the virus, and 3M has been doing nothing but dissembling. We can't get any data out. ","800432","8"
"8368","The President just signed -- literally, I just came from the West Wing, he just signed the Defense Production Act, which going to crack down on the export of masks by two types of bad actors. One are these brokers operating in shady black markets that have been vacuuming up masks and other protective gear here and exporting. We're going to stop that right at the border with the help of C.B.P. and the Post Office and the Express Mail consigners. ","800432","8"
"8369","And for shutdown Whitmer, many other Democrats, the rules don't apply to them. They'll have you arrested for going to church, or if you are having a funeral even though you wear a mask in New York. But then they'll participate in protests with zero social distancing. ","628186","9"
"8370","It's unclear what point David Dorn was shot but police say he was hit by gunfire inside the shop and was able to make it outside where he collapsed on the sidewalk. These suspects, as you see, were wearing masks you can also see the video very clear. Police are hopeful that somebody will recognize them and if you do, call St. Louis police. ","628186","9"
"8371","But that's going to come to play soon. How is Joe Biden going to handle that when he can't even admit he was part of unmasking Michael Flynn and it's in black-and-white?","112423","9"
"8372","Why do you need to unmask General Flynn? What were you told? What did Barack Obama say and what did you say to Barack Obama? None of that is being presented to Joe Biden in any way if there is pressure on him.","112423","9"
"8373","FLEISCHER: Let me just add this, there is a reason people are masked to begin with. And anybody who cares about civil liberty should pay attention to it. You're masked because the government did not have a warrant and they listen to your phone calls. People should be masked. That should be the proposition and we should be aware that somebody is unmasked, not common.","112423","9"
"8374","All right, coming up, KT McFarland and Reince Priebus will weigh in on the unmasking scandal that is now rocking Washington and the swamp, as well as the left.","112423","9"
"8375","This week, we witnessed bombshell new developments and perhaps the biggest abuse of power scandal in American history. The president is calling it Obamagate and in a recent interview with Maria Bartiromo, he had a strong message for those who abuse their power in the Flynn unmasking scandal.","112423","9"
"8376","And remember, as Trey Gowdy pointed out, leaking Flynn's unmasked name to the media is a felony punishable up to ten years in prison.","112423","9"
"8377","I also see you got McCabe told you that they didn't have any evidence tying Papadopoulos to Russia. He said the unverified dossier, if they didn't have it, they wouldn't get the FISA application. You asked Samantha Power about her role as U.N. ambassador and what would it for example be the same as Ambassador Rice's why did she unmask of these people because you called her the largest on unmasker in U.S. history. ","136134","9"
"8378","GOWDY: I'll tell you, Samantha Powers explanation all to scare the hell out of you, Sean, which is she said I didn't make those unmasking requests. Somebody on my team may have made them, but I didn't make them. ","136134","9"
"8379","I mean, keep in mind, somebody unmasked Michael Flynn's name. Somebody unmasked his name and then gave that to President Obama. It wasn't Sally Yates. She didn't know anything about it. ","136134","9"
"8380","And by the way, at bigger venues, OK, I want to open stadiums. How about temperature checks? You have a high temperature, you pulled the side, and you say, we'll give you tickets to another game. Increased screening process. Let people at stadiums wear masks. ","136134","9"
"8381","As they enter an arena or stadium, the key is to be safe, take the precautions, use common sense. I say, if I have to wear the mask, I'll wear it. ","136134","9"
"8382","You can defecate in the streets in California as long as you're not clutching a bunch of banned plastic straws, you're good to go. Make sure you're wearing your face mask while you're doing it. ","136134","9"
"8383","They're dividing -- they're doing the same thing in restaurants, you know, so one get their nails done, you put it underneath like -- but there's a division, everyone has a mask on, clever, smart, I like the ingenuity, and health people I'm talking to are cautiously optimistic about it. ","234556","9"
"8384","Look, obviously, there are geographical -- the density of the population in New York, different situation, understand. I like the ingenuity of people thinking of ways to open restaurants, salons. I think we could probably -- even Dr. Fauci said stadiums hopefully sooner than later, if ever -- like for me, I'll wear a mask, Governor. ","234556","9"
"8385","And he's not wearing a mask. ","234556","9"
"8386","As state and local governments attempt to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, someone now being accused of trampling the constitutional rights of American citizens. For example, in Houston a new mandate would find residence 1,000 bucks just for not wearing a mask in public. Houston's police union president is calling the measure draconian. Others are protesting the mandate, which is now facing a court challenge. ","878860","9"
"8387","Yes, there has to be a rationality. Any time governor asks the citizenry to do something there has to be a rational basis for it, and the greater the freedom you infringe, the more compelling the reason has to be. So, if I'm going to imprison you or fine you for not wearing a mask, why can I hold you down and vaccinate you against the flu this fall? I mean, you don't want the flu and COVID-19, so can I involuntarily vaccinate you? Can I show up at your house and make sure you are doing your burpees and planks and your jumping jacks because obesity and COVID-19 don't go well together? Where does it stop? ","878860","9"
"8388","And in Houston, Governor, if you can believe this, they are threatening to punish people for not wearing a mask. Meanwhile, on Washington state, they are going to let a serial killer, they are one vote away from letting a serial killer out because of COVID-19. ","878860","9"
"8389","So, you go to jail for not wearing a mask but if you kill four dozen women because of COVID-19, we might let you out. That is a rational. ","878860","9"
"8390","Incubations are also on the decline, that continues. The death rate appears to have flattened, and thanks to the president's numerous actions, New York never ran data ventilators, never ran out of hospital beds. Received millions and millions of masks, and gloves, and gowns, and shields from the federal stockpile. ","399379","9"
"8391","Now, masks, gloves, temperature checks to get into any building. Wearing a mask in the building, half the workforce should continue to work remotely, from home, so you have more social distancing in every New York City building. ","399379","9"
"8392","If it means, OK, I want to go to the game, you got to put on a mask. It's not ideal. You can eat popcorn, but you can probably go like this and eat a -- take a bite of your hot dog and chew it with your mask on, and then take a straw and drink your beer. ","399379","9"
"8393","Randy told me, he'll make masks with Yankee emblems on it. How cool is that? I should -- I probably shouldn't have said that. ","399379","9"
"8394","HANNITY: Senator, we take the temperature. Everybody has to wear a mask. You have to sip your beer through a straw. ","399379","9"
"8395","HANNITY: When we come back -- I'll drink -- I'd rather drink the beer through the straw. I'd rather take the hot dog -- and chew it under the mask. ","399379","9"
"8396","HANNITY: -- and everybody else wears a mask, and you drink beer through a straw, you eat hot dogs, but you can't eat peanuts or popcorn, I think most New Yorkers have the choices, you got to do that or you don't go, I vote to go. That's my vote. ","399379","9"
"8397","Same with New York City, if half the workforce stays home, now you have social distancing in every office. To get into an office, you get your temperature checked. Everyone in the office, for a while, I know it sucks, but you have to wear a mask, you have to wear gloves for a small period of time. That will all go away after the -- after the fall. ","399379","9"
"8398","HANNITY: -- just for a short period of time wearing a mask? I would. That's my -- I'm not -- I don't speak for all New Yorkers. ","399379","9"
"8399","HANNITY: -- I'll go to the first game with you, and you get the benefit of not hearing me chatting. I've got a mask on, and I'm six feet away, you're lucky. ","399379","9"
"8400","GIULIANI: Can I yell at the umpires -- can you yell at the umpires through the mask? That's the important thing. ","399379","9"
"8401","HANNITY: Farmers in Wisconsin are farming. They are packaging. The manufacturers of the gowns, the gloves, the shields, the masks, the ventilators, they are all working. ","399379","9"
"8402","Breaking today, the CDC is now recommending that all Americans wear face masks, that's new today, or other facial coverings when traveling outside the home. And it's all comes as the president utilizes the Defense Production Act to ban certain exports of critical medical supplies. He did this because 3M -- they were selling masks made -- American-made masks, N95 masks, to other countries. Hello? ","744762","9"
"8403","And, by the way, the company CEO said stopping international shipments would have significant humanitarian implications. That -- we didn't elect you for that. Americans need the masks. Who are you to decide that? ","744762","9"
"8404","And U.S. company should not have been giving those masks abroad when this country so desperately needs them here. The president was right to take action. Now the U.S. is even allowing imports of what are called KN95 masks, the Chinese alternative to the critical N95 masks and we do know the production GM, Ford and others, they are beginning to crank them out as well. ","744762","9"
"8405","Why has there been so much confusion on the issue of surgical masks? ","744762","9"
"8406","And the science originally told us that people who wear masks are not protecting themselves from the virus. We actually recommend that people who have symptoms or people who think they may have the disease to wear a mask so they don't spread it to others. And the WHO, the CDC and my office all initially stated that. ","744762","9"
"8407","What's changed? Well, what changed is we found that there are significant number of people who have asymptomatic spread of the virus, and so the CDC changed its recommendations today and they now suggest that the general public consider wearing masks when they're going out in public so as not to spread disease to other people, particularly in situations where they may be closer than six feet from each other. ","744762","9"
"8408","If you're going to wear facial covering, please make sure you don't touch your face and that you wash your hands so you weren't contaminating yourself. And leave the N95 in the surgical masks to the health care professionals because they need them to take care of high risk patients. A cloth facial covering is what the CDC recommends, that works just fine to protect other people from you because we're all in this together. You wear a mask to protect me and I wear it to protect you, Sean. ","744762","9"
"8409","HANNITY: Can you tell Americans tonight that we have enough masks, that we'll have enough ventilators? Do -- I mean, these are important questions. And I know we've been getting the daily briefings. We know what GM is doing, we know that the Defense Act was utilized by the president for ventilators and now today as it relates to 3M. ","744762","9"
"8410","Cuomo, on the other hand, he has been complaining each and every day. And sure, he's going to show up for a photo outfit, let's see, the Javits Center hospital that Donald Trump and the federal government constructed, the Army Corps of Engineers, he's accepting thousands of ventilators, and he threw in a warehouse, millions of masks and gowns and going around on TV and take a photo-up in front of the ship, the Comfort that, by the way, only had 20 people today, I'm not sure why, and bash the administration and demanding they do their job, yesterday tweeting: We do not have enough ventilators period. ","744762","9"
"8411","It sort of slipped away and I think we need a little humbleness here. Medicine advances mistake by mistake. So, masks, they're back, right? I mean, go figure. ","744762","9"
"8412","And this liturgical garb. One it was pink hats. Not it's black masks and skinny jeans, with the occasional brick. We even have public confession. The other night, Jimmy Fallon apologized for wearing blackface in a 2000 ""SNL"" sketch. Then he spent time in a virtual confession box with the head of the NAACP. ","475084","10"
"8413","You look at how they live their lives, where they send their kids to school, what they do, who they associate with, and they're not very liberal at all. And you can really see that in Joe Biden. When moments slip off the mask and all of a sudden, put you all in change, and Barack Obama is the first articulate black we've ever had, and you aren't black if you vote for Trump. So-- ","710690","10"
"8414","HANSON: --the mask slips off sometimes, but-- ","710690","10"
"8415","(END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Except not even the left's most reliable source for smearing their opponents as bigots could back up this narrative saying, ""I have not seen any clear evidence that white supremacists or militiamen are masking up and going out to burn and loot."" Howard Graves, research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center. ","710690","10"
"8416","ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: I guess when you see the beaches of Alabama crowded with people - no social distancing, not wearing masks, are you concerned? ","710690","10"
"8417","And now we have some pictures of some who are being arrested, who are violating the curfew, and perhaps others who have committed violence. And you're saying the protester -- can't really hear the individuals through the mask all that well. This is just some of what we are seeing play out in New York tonight, and we'll go back to that and keep that picture up so you can see that. ","710690","10"
"8418","LARA LOGAN, HOST, LARA LOGAN HAS NO AGENDA, FOX NATION: Well, what they're doing, Laura, is exploiting the existing conditions and exploiting the local residents, exploiting the very justified outpouring of grief and anger. They specialize in masking themselves behind genuine protesters, and exploiting these opportunities to agitate and destroy. These are professional antagonizers. They've been trained. They have manuals on how to do this with their tactics, their techniques, and their procedures. ","974789","10"
"8419","And if you look at them in the crowd, you can start to pick them out because they're very different to the rest of the protestors. They typically wear black, all dressed in black - not always. They have different levels in the hierarchical structure. But you will see the ones, especially that are in this subculture of real professional antagonists and instigators. And they wear all in black. They often have equipment on their backs. They'll have gas masks that aren't the typical gasmasks. Theirs are the expensive ones. They will have DSLR cameras which cost thousands and thousands of dollars that the average protester doesn't have. They'll have communications equipment, like radios with miniature grade antennas. You'll see they have earpieces in their ears. There are repeaters on top of vehicles. ","974789","10"
"8420","We're going to show you also why the President's warning about potential fraud is right on target. And Raymond Arroyo now it's Tuesday, so it's a little unusual, but he's here on the Trump-Biden mask showdown. And what Memorial Day could tell us about the campaign. But first, those who bet against America. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. ","598394","10"
"8421","Now, what worries these hypocrites is not the dire situation they created in their own states. They're worried about the possibility of your state's economic recovery. Trump could be poised to benefit from the dramatic numbers produced during the partial rebound phrase that is likely to coincide with the four months before November. That realization has many Democrats spooked. Now, let that sink in for a moment.  Where you and I are spooked about the idea of living like masked zombies, waiting for government checks for this foreseeable future, the Democrats are spooked by the idea that things are getting better. ","598394","10"
"8422","INGRAHAM: But Karl, you're talking about the encouraging snitching on your fellow citizens and she didn't wear a mask, and he opened up too early and you cut the hair of a protester. How dare you? So, I've never seen that ever in the United States of America. But we have elected officials encouraging that type of neighbor, spying upon neighbor to tell the authorities. I don't think that washes well in the United States of America. Well, I don't think it works.  MANKE: You know, we need in Michigan right now at this point, you know, we need to stand up. We need to stand up. We need to open up our businesses. And we need to show up. This police state tactic that turns one neighbor on another, one neighbor scolding another one for not being social distance. Another one scolding another one for not wearing a mask. They love this kind of crap. ","598394","10"
"8423","RALPH NORTHAM, GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA: Wearing a mask could literally save someone else's life. That is becoming clearer every day as we move further into managing this virus over the long-term.  (END VIDEO CLIP) ","598394","10"
"8424","INGRAHAM: So, it was stunning to see him the very next day, walking around Virginia Beach, taking selfies with strangers right up against him, unmasked the very activity he just said could actually kill people. OK, so you obviously didn't believe that is what I'm saying earlier. They don't believe what they're saying. They just want to control you. Now, was he embarrassed? Not in the slightest.  In fact, he's now making what he failed to do mandatory in public for all members of the Commonwealth of Virginia.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ","598394","10"
"8425","INGRAHAM: And by the way if you think that's ever going to be rescinded. He wants us masked from here on out. OK, he's been exposed as a hypocrite. All Virginians now have to suffer. But is this even constitutional. Article 1, Section 1 of Virginia's constitution states that this is just - let me read it. Can you back it up, guys? Actually, want to read that. Yes. So, people know what I'm saying. Well, let me just read this really quickly.  That all men are, by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherent rights of which when they enter into a state of society, they cannot by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity. And that all powers vested in and consequently derived by the people that magistrates are their trustees and servants and at all times amenable to them. ","598394","10"
"8426","Joining me now, Harmeet Dhillon, Civil Rights Attorney, Founder of the Center for American Liberty. Do Virginians, Harmeet, have a legal case against the mask mandate and other orders such as those?  HARMEET DHILLON, FOUNDER, CENTER FOR AMERICAN LIBERTY: Well, thank you, Laura. Clearly, the governor himself is very comfortable, masked or in blackface, but most of us aren't. And so, the question is, can they do it the way that they're planning to do it? So, the way that Virginia is doing it is different than some other states, Laura. They're actually saying that they're going to find the businesses, the restaurants, those places where people go indoors, not the actual citizens of Virginia, like you or I who might walk in. So that's interesting. That becomes an economic regulation that subject to rational basis scrutiny. ","598394","10"
"8427","Now, if it is true, as we've been told, I think you've said this on your show before, that maybe the masks don't work, or they can't prove that they work. I mean, Governor Northam didn't think they worked enough this weekend to wear one. Then maybe we can disprove the rational basis that the government is saying applies here. And I think that would be one route to go. ","598394","10"
"8428","Other challenges to masks have included that masks are an expressive form of communication. They communicate a message. In this case, I'm scared or, you know, as the Left would say, I care about you. And can the state compel us to carry that message forward? So, I could see a cause of action where an individual going into a store says, I do not wish to convey that message. And there's no rational basis for it. So, I'd like to challenge it. So, I think it's going to raise some interesting issues in that regard, Laura. ","598394","10"
"8429","INGRAHAM: Yes, well, if it's all for safety, then everyone should know this is not a temporary thing. These - they will - if they get real power, pass a rulemaking at the Department of Transportation mandating that masks from here on out on public transportation, whether it's a plane or a bus, forever, not just now, because, if that's the argument, then you've got to wear it all the time during flu season, forever masked. So, that's sort of stuff. It's not just during COVID. It's forever. ","598394","10"
"8430","INGRAHAM: And in moments, Raymond Arroyo will break down Joe Biden's racial blunder culminating in a ridiculous softball interview on CNN. Plus the new development mask-gate. ""Seen and Unseen"" unmasked when we come back. ","598394","10"
"8431","RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Laura, if you look closely what happened during those dueling Memorial Day ceremonies, voters look at this. They are looking for signs. They are looking for impressions of how they should vote. Biden emerged from his basement for the first time in two months to lay a wreath at a war memorial near his home in Delaware. It was a grim look. He wore a black mask, the dark gray bands. Even his gait was tentative. He projected an image of trepidation, even fear. ","598394","10"
"8432","Trump on the other hand, appeared at Fort McHenry. He is surrounded by the Drum and Fife Corps, flags are waving behind him, no mask. He seemed to be aligning himself, visually at least, with that American spirit of defiance in the face of adversity. It even had the touch of revolutionary spirit about it, Laura. And I think voters are picking up on this. Whether they recognize it or not, it is there. They see it, they feel it. ","598394","10"
"8433","INGRAHAM: I don't think America is -- I don't think they want masks long- term, even if short term they will do the mask because they think it's safe. I think they are worried that this is going to become the new normal forever, which I think the blue state governors want. They need a visual to keep this narrative going since the curve has long since been flattening, they need that visual to keep people scared. And the mask for some, not saying it has no use, but for some, it keeps that visual front and center. ","598394","10"
"8434","ARROYO: Well, whether it has use or not, Dr. Fauci a few months ago said it had very little use. But from Joe Biden it is virtue signaling. It's a way to set himself off from Trump. And in his first in-person interview in two months he sat down 12 feet apart from CNN's Dana Bash and explained why he wore the mask on Memorial Day. ","598394","10"
"8435","JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I watched the president yesterday wearing no mask, and making fun of the fact that I wore a mask. The truth of the matter is that I think you're supposed to lead by example. And one of the things our governor has said, he wants to keep social distancing, stay at home has been the order until June 1. ","598394","10"

"8438","INGRAHAM: I love it when people are wearing a mask in their own cars down the street. ","598394","10"
"8439","But we now know, we the elderly are more vulnerable. If you have certain conditions, you're more vulnerable. Trust the people, the information out there. You post the information. You provide the mask. Although, I'm sure you're finding ways to allow us to eat and have the mask nearby. But these arbitrary numbers are just nonsense. They should be gotten rid of. Use your judgment and the people will make the decision is this safe or unsafe? You've got to have revenue. ","862573","10"
"8440","INGRAHAM: Coming up, as Americans start emerging from lockdown, they are coming up with creative ways to eat and drink while wearing masks.

","862573","10"
"8441","ARROYO: The innovation of people is simply incredible, Laura. At times, it's a bit scary, I have to admit. Some of these inventors made headlines this week for a mask that could be won at restaurants. You simply hit the button, and it opens to allow eating. Now this disturbs me a little bit, because just dashed eat outside. You don't need to wear the mask if you're outside and socially distanced. I get worried about that thing. ","862573","10"
"8442","But I think I can top it, Laura. A New Orleans artist has unveiled the drinking mask. It allows for easier, hands-free, social distance drinking. There' a little slip for a straw in the mask. It has an interior flap that covers the hole when it is not in use. That seems to be a good creation. I kind of like that idea. ","862573","10"
"8443","INGRAHAM: Well, Taurean, you're fighting for your survival - your way of life, your survival.

"8450","Now, we're going be examining the shifting goalposts from the meaning of flattening the curve, remember that? To whether we should wear masks in public? How can the public be confident in what they're hearing from the health officials if things keep changing? ","432193","10"
"8451","INGRAHAM: And finally, about the issue of masks in public. ","432193","10"
"8452","DR. JEROME ADAMS, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: There are things that people can do to stay safe. There are things they shouldn't be doing. And one of the things they shouldn't be doing, the general public, is going out and buying masks. ","432193","10"
"8453","GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): Wearing a mask is one of the best things that we can do. If you get on the bus, you need to wear a mask. If you get in a train, you need to wear a mask. ","432193","10"
"8454","ARROYO: Laura, he's the Charlie Chaplin of politics, he just holds up the mask. Maybe that's a better way to communicate moving forward than trying to talk. Using no words may be the best path at this point. ","432193","10"
"8455","BILL FROM TEXAS: My question is if I have a small collection of masks that I use for myself and for my family members, what's the best way to sanitize those masks so I can reuse them? ","403906","10"
"8456","PETER HOTEZ, MD, TX CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL CENTER FOR VACCINE DEVELOPMENT: Yes. Actually, the CDC has a nice website now about cloth masks for use at home. They do recommend cloth and it turns out just plain old washing in the washing machine seems to be adequate. ","403906","10"
"8457","A couple things to be careful, though, you want to not use cloth masks on kids especially under the age of two primarily because of the choking risk. And also individuals who are debilitated and can't remove the masks themselves, be very careful about that. So, look at the website, it actually tells you how to construct the mask. ","403906","10"
"8458","Nothing else is worked better when administered early as well as midterm in a patient's fight against the virus. Finally about facemasks. ","534929","10"
"8459","INGRAHAM: But does that mean the president should wear a mask too? ","534929","10"
"8460","INGRAHAM: This went on and on by the way. Why are you not wearing a mask? It is the most ridiculous series of questions on the mask with the president today but I was thinking about this. If you could kill - if really you could guarantee tonight that you'd get rid of the virus and we'll all go back to work, if it took like wearing I don't know, what tire hazmat costume or maybe a big full Chewbacca costume, I'd do it. ","534929","10"
"8461","INGRAHAM: But then Congressman, Congressman, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you but isn't - wasn't it the CDC that you know kind of screwed this up from the beginning? I mean no offense but I mean we have to wait for the CDC. We have to wait for the curve, wait for the apex, comes down, goes up. The model changes. Most people are like, look, I'll wear a mask, whatever I have to do. ","534929","10"
"8462","Tell me do I wear a mask, do I wear gloves? If I can get tested of antibody test? Just tell me what I have to do so we can get back to work to solve the problems that are going to be rippling across everyone's lives and help the people who are most vulnerable to this disease at the same time. ","534929","10"
"8463","And up ahead, the CDC is now recommending everyone wear cloth masks in public. So why now? And if it so important, why did it take so long? And why the confusion? Will it slow the spread? Scientist Jeremy Howard will answer those questions and more, next. ","534929","10"
"8464","UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A surgical mask doesn't protect you from a respiratory illness. ","534929","10"
"8465","DR. KAVITA PATEL, FORMER OBAMA WHITE HOUSE HEALTH POLICY DIRECTOR: In an ideal world, we would have the public being masked when they go out. ","534929","10"
"8466","INGRAHAM: So which is it, masks, no masks, Halloween masks cloth mask? The CDC is settling the debate and recommending, not requiring, people wear face masks when they're out in public and they can't physical distance, but not the kind the doctors are using. ","534929","10"
"8467","JEREMY HOWARD, UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO RESEARCH SCIENTIST: The worst mask is your skin. You don't want infected droplets touching your face, and you don't want potentially infected droplets coming out of you and touching somebody else. So the messages here is cover up. Honestly, it doesn't matter too much what the actual cover is. Pretty much any kind of cloth cover will protect about 99 percent of the tiny droplets that fly out when you talk. And it's those droplets that are actually mainly causing this infection. ","534929","10"
"8468","INGRAHAM: Dr. Howard, I want to play this little clip from a how-to video, I love these, for a very popular homemade cloth mask. Watch. ","534929","10"
"8469","HOWARD: Let me show you something. This is what a mask looks like when a data scientist makes it. I just cut up a t-shirt and I just tie it around my head, and it works great. It's actually based on the latest scientific research. Cambridge University says two layers of cotton is great. And Chinese researchers found the best material just about is a kitchen paper towel. So I just have a bit of t-shirt, stick a bit of towel in the middle, tie it around my head. And I've got something that works. ","534929","10"
"8470","INGRAHAM: Very cute. And Professor, when you look at the way people are reacting in stores and stuff, a week ago, people were shocked to see people in masks. Now people are like hey, how are you doing? I'm good. And it's like, oh, I love what you did with that. It's becoming, I love the twist. How did you make your knot? It really is -- it's a sight to see it. Here is a really creative idea from Denise, the mother of our senior producer. She wanted to make a mask out of only household supplies, and this is what she did. ","534929","10"
"8471","UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I took two sheets of a paper towel, just kept folding this way, the next way, over again. I just two rubber bands, folded them over on the edge and stapled them. Here's the mask. ","534929","10"
"8472","INGRAHAM: And just think, people were buying up all these things on Amazon for $150 for one mask three or four weeks ago. So from now on, until when, Dr. Howard, would we have to wear the masks? Forever? ","534929","10"
"8473","HOWARD: Until a few weeks after lockdown, or stay in place orders are done. Masks are amazing. They cut the rate of transmission up to half. And scientists have estimated that if 80 percent of the people in a community wear a mask, it would actually completely halt the transmission. So it's kind of like -- it is seeming like it's now the number one tool right now, and so if we keep the masks on for a while -- ","534929","10"
